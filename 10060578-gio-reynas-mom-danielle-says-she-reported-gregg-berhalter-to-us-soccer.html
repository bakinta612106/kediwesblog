Those messages began after Giovanni was told he would have a "limited role" at the World Cup.</p><p>"The messages began after his son, Gio Reyna, was informed he would have a limited role at the tournament," per Carlisle and Bonagura.</p><p>Claudio Reyna said he was "upset by Gregg's comments about Gio after the U.S. was out of the World Cup" and "shared my frustrations about my son's World Cup experience with a number of close friends."

He and Rosalind reconciled and were later married.</p><p>"The lessons learned from that night over three decades ago became the foundation for a loving, devoted, and supportive relationship, which we honored and celebrated with our 25th wedding anniversary this past weekend," he said.</p><p>Berhalter wrote that somebody had reached out to U.S. Soccer in "an apparent effort to leverage something very personal from long ago to bring about the end of my relationship with U.S. Soccer."</p><p>In conjunction with Berhalter's statement, U.S. Soccer announced it empowered the law firm of Alston & Bird LLP to conduct an independent investigation into allegations against the coach. The scope of the inquiry then grew.</p>U.S. Soccer <span class=acct>@ussoccer</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Statement from U.S. Soccer: &lt;a href="https://t.co/h2x5rgZvWA">pic.twitter.com/h2x5rgZvWA&lt;/a></p><p>"Through this process, U.S. Soccer has learned about potential inappropriate behavior towards multiple members of our staff by individuals outside of our organization," the federation said. "We take such behavior seriously and have expanded our investigation to include those allegations."</p><p>Gio Reyna's lack of playing time was among the secondary storylines surrounding the United States at the 2022 World Cup as the team was knocked out in the round of 16. He made two appearances and logged <a href=# rel=noopener>53 total minutes</a> on the pitch in Qatar, which came as a surprise since the 20-year-old is widely considered one of the most promising young talents on the national team.</p><p>After the USMNT's tournament ended, Berhalter appeared at a leadership summit, where he divulged there was a player within the squad who "was clearly not meeting expectations on and off the field," and he and his staff contemplated sending the player home. Those comments ended up getting published in a <a href=# rel=noopener>Charterworks briefing</a>.</p><p>It came out that Gio Reyna was the player in question.</p><p>In an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram post</a>, Reyna said he was "devastated" upon learning he was going to have a "limited" role at the World Cup. He said he "let my emotions get the best of me and affect my training and behavior for a few days after learning about my limited role" and apologized to Berhalter and his teammates.</p><p>Berhalter no longer appears to be in charge of the men's national team. His contract expired at the end of 2022, and Stewart <a href=# rel=noopener>announced</a> Wednesday that Anthony Hudson will run the squad's upcoming training camp.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZmWCeISMoKCoZaKaxq%2Bt0makqKVdma6vtcSlo55lo5bGtHnSoZxmqpWlvLPAxJ1koKqVnLRursSrn5qkpJq%2FbsDOZqysZaOksKSx0Q%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./following-deadly-fire-jfrd-provides-new-smoke-detectors-along-n-main-street.html><span>←</span><span>Following deadly fire, JFRD provides new smoke detectors along N.
