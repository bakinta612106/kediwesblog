It’s almost too much of a good thing.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Typically the issues subside within one to four weeks of the COVID-19 infection, according to Freeman.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘The best way to avoid Covid Toes is to get vaccinated,’ Freeman said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Rodgers was clearly bothered by the issue on Sunday, and even went to the locker room before halftime to be examined by trainers and team doctors.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cold weather, like the kind found in Green Bay this time of year, can be an exacerbating factor. Fortunately, Rodgers has only to play Sunday against the visiting Los Angeles Rams before the Packers go on their bye week, when the California native will be able to go to a warmer client and recuperate.</p><img decoding=async id=i-68c613c8b43cdce3 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/11/24/16/50883415-10238757-Howard_Stern_continued_his_attacks_on_f_head_Green_Bay_Packers_q-m-25_1637769902685.jpg height=443 width=306 alt="Howard Stern continued his attacks on 'f***head' Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers this week for what the SiriusXM host characterized as his lie about being vaccinated" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p></p><img decoding=async id=i-b23d47fa327e9dc0 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/11/24/16/50920641-10238757-image-m-23_1637769756691.jpg height=443 width=306 alt="Stern didn't hesitate to seize on Rodgers's toe injury to illustrate another point about the reigning NFL MVP.
