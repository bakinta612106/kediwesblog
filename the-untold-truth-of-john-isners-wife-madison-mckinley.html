She has recently given birth to their second child.</p><h2><span id=Early_life_and_family>Early life and family</span></h2><p>Madison McKinley was born on 15 November 1992, in Dallas, Texas USA; her zodiac sign is Scorpio, and she holds American nationality. Madison was born to parents Karla and Mark McKinley, and has two brothers – Charlie and Key. Madison is very close to her grandmother from mother’s side, Diana D’Elia. Her grandmother from her father’s side, Helen McKinley, has also been very supportive to Madison, spending a lot of time with her when she was a kid, as Madison’s mother is a breast-cancer survivor. They both donate to the foundations which support women and families who faced this disease. Karla is the co-founder and co-owner of Madison’s jewelry company.</p><h2><span id=Educational_background>Educational background</span></h2><p>Madison matriculated from her local high school in 2009, and enrolled at Parsons School of Design, which educated such world famous designers as Marc Jacobs, Tom Ford and Alexander Wang. Madison graduated from the college in 2012 with a BFA in Fashion/Apparel Design, and later enrolled at the University of Texas, Austin, from which she graduated with a BFA in Studio Arts, General, in 2016.</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>When Madison was only 17 years old, she and her mother founded the company called Madison LLC. It was officially registered in November 2009, and Karla became the director of the company, while Madison held the position of a designer and creative director, and started practicing specifically as an apparel designer.</p><p>Right after her graduation, Madison went back home to work at her family’s Steerhead Ranch located in Buffalo, Wyoming, where she stayed for around nine months working there as a cowgirl. Later she started working for KOCH company as an accessories designer in their office in Dallas. She worked there until 2015, when she finally understood she wanted to make her own jewelry brand. She discussed her idea with her mother, and the latter supported her daughter, as usual.</p><h3><span id=Madison_McKinleys_Jewelry_Company>Madison McKinley’s Jewelry Company</span></h3><p>While founding her own jewelry brand Madison recalled it was something she dreamt of since her childhood. Her mother also admitted that since her early age Madison was fond of creating things, being inspired with wild nature and Texas lifestyle.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographypedia.org///biographypedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/42765790_585585575209062_3228243641835192320_o.jpg></p><p>In 2017 the jewelry brand Madison McKinley was launched, and Karla and Madison released their first collection of earrings, necklaces and bracelets. Madison makes all the pieces by herself in her workshop in Dallas. The main idea of the brand is to mix the timeless rustic style with contemporary fashion trends, so the items from Madison McKinley could fit in any woman’s jewelry box. They also work with various kinds of metal, wood, precious and semi-precious stones and handmade beads. Madison clearly sees the type of her potential customer: ‘She’s a girl on the go and has her own sense of style. She likes to stand out in an understated way.&nbsp; She’s one of a kind, spontaneous, daring and a risk taker’, she shared her concept of her jewelry style.</p><p>D Magazine named Madison “Best Fashion Jewelry Designer” of 2018. Madison has collaborations with such brands as Wrangler and Veronica Beard.</p><h2><span id=Personal_life_husband_John_Isner>Personal life, husband John Isner</span></h2><p>Madison met John Isner in 2011 in Houston, Texas, at a tennis tournament, and started dating the same year. Their relationship was appreciated and supported by both families, and Madison made friends with John’s sister, Carrie Jo. John proposed to Madison on 26 June 2017, and Madison announced their engagement on her Instagram account. The wedding ceremony was held in Montage Palmetto Bluff, South California on 4 December 2017, attended by famous American tennis players Sam Querrey, Justin Gimelstob (who was also John’s coach from 2014 to 2016) and Steve Johnson.</p><p>The details of the ceremony decorations were featured in D Weddings Magazine in Summer 2020 issue. The newlyweds spent their honeymoon on Mustique Island, which became their favorite travel destination.</p><h3><span id=Who_is_John_Isner>Who is John Isner?</span></h3><p>John Robert Isner is a professional American tennis player, who was born on 26 April 1985, in Greensboro, North Carolina USA. In 2017 the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) ranked John as #8 among male tennis players. John started playing tennis on the professional level in 2007, right after his graduation from the University of Georgia with a BA in speech communication. In 2010 he played the longest match in history against Nicolas Mahut, lasting 11 hours in general, but in fact over two days – 22 June 2010 and 24 June 2010, as the game was suspended because it got too dark, while the score of the fifth set was 59-59.</p><p>Isner won the match eventually. In 2017 he won an ATP tournament without having a single break point against him. As of 2020, John now works at the Saddlebrook Academy as a trainer.</p><h3><span id=Happy_with_two_children>Happy… with two children</span></h3><p>Madison gave birth to their first child, daughter Hunter Grace on 15 September 2018. John and Madison’s first son and second child, was born on 20 October 2019, and is named John Hobbs Isner; the happy parents didn’t hesitate to post his pictures on their social media accounts. Madison shared that she has always wanted to have a big family, so she wanted to have as many babies as she is fortunate to have.</p><h2><span id=Hobbies_favorite_things_and_interesting_facts>Hobbies, favorite things and interesting facts</span></h2><p>Madison is very religious, as all the members of her family, starting at least from her grandmother. She <a rel=nofollow href=#>praises</a> Jesus in many messages she posts on her Instagram account, sharing that ‘all she does in her life happens to her by Lord’s grace’.</p><p>When a child, Madison enjoyed watching Disney cartoons; her favorite one was “Cinderella”, and she especially loved the moment when Cinderella’s friends (mice and birds) help her to make her own dress for the ball. She reflects that maybe it was the moment when she was inspired by the process of creating, making things with one’s own hands and feeling happy with the final result.</p><p>Madison speaks Spanish fluently, and really enjoyed studying it at school. She also likes traveling, swimming and walking. She plays tennis, and enjoyed this game even being pregnant, not being confused by the growing baby bump. She has a dog named Miss B. She had a Golden Retriever named Hank, but he only lived with her for a year and a half, and then passed away. Madison <a rel=nofollow href=#>shared</a> her feelings on the loss on her Instagram post: ‘I loved life with you. You brought so much joy into our family. Thank you for the best year and a half ever. Now I know you will be our baby girl’s sweet guardian. I will remember you always’, she wrote and got a lot of support and kind words from her followers and friends.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Isn't it John's girlfriend Madison McKinley sitting among the Isner's team? <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/uqcerN1k</a></p><p>— John Isner Fan (@IsnerFan) <a rel=nofollow href=#>March 17, 2012</a></p><h2><span id=Appearance_clothing_style>Appearance, clothing style</span></h2><p>Madison has long light brown hair and hazel eyes. She is 5ft 8ins (1.73m) tall and weighs around 132lbs (60kgs), returning to her pre-pregnancy form very quickly as she works out a lot. As to her clothing style, Madison is very thoughtful about everything she wears – she likes pastel shades of blue, pink and beige in her wardrobe, enjoys wearing denim overalls and likes cowboy hats. Madison’s favorite accessory is sunglasses. She says that her grandmothers are her biggest fashion inspiration!</p><h2><span id=Net_worth_and_salary>Net worth and salary</span></h2><p>As of 2020, Madison’s net worth is estimated to be around <a rel=nofollow href=#>$1 million</a>, while the net worth of her husband John Isner, is estimated to be around <a rel=nofollow href=#>$14 million.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCpnZSerm%2B70aBmraCVYsKvwM6lm2asoqrBqXnOn2Sjp5ijeqq%2FzZ6prGWnnrOmecyam6Krn6N6rq%2FKoqWlnalk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-athens-area-diaper-bank-gets-a-new-space.html><span>←</span><span>The Athens Area Diaper Bank Gets a New Space!</span></a>
