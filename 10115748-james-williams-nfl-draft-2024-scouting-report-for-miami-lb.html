Lacks the short-area quickness to get in and out of his breaks.</p><p>— Reliant on using his hands in man coverage. Will fall out of phase when he doesn't get his hands on his man.</p><p>— Instincts as a run defender are a work in progress. Often freezes and takes too long to read plays when lined up in the box and will fall for eye candy.</p><p>— Needs to improve at taking on blocks. Didn't get much experience doing so as a college safety.</p><p><b>2023 STATISTICS</b></p><p>— 12 G, 73 TOT, 0.5 TFL, 0 SK, 1 INT, 5 PD, 2 FF</p><p>— Born Feb. 15, 2003</p><p>— 5-star recruit in the 2021 class, per <a href=# rel=noopener>247Sports</a></p><p>— 2022 (Torn labrum in left shoulder, played through it and had offseason surgery), 2021 (Groin, missed 2 games and had offseason surgery)</p><p>Coming out of high school, James Williams was the No. 1 safety recruit in his class. However, as is the recent trend with the bigger strong-safety types of defensive backs in college, he profiles better as a linebacker in the NFL.</p><p>That makes Williams a project at linebacker, where he should at least be decent in coverage to begin his professional career. He needs work against the run and more experience taking on blocks while playing in the box, but he has plenty of athleticism and can make offensive linemen and tight ends miss with his movement skills.</p><p>The former Hurricane showed plenty of physicality at safety to suggest he can handle himself on the second level. It's also encouraging to see that he's already put on weight, and he has a good frame with impressive arm length.</p><p>He got reps at linebacker at the Senior Bowl and had some good moments, but it was clear that he'll need some time to make the position switch. Whatever team drafts Williams will need to be patient with him, but he has a high ceiling at the position and is worth the dice roll for a club that doesn't need an immediate starter.</p><p><b>GRADE</b>: 6.0 (High-Level Developmental Prospect — 5th Round)</p><p><b>OVERALL RANK</b>: 170</p><p><b>POSITION RANK</b>: LB11</p><p><b>PRO COMPARISON: </b>Divine Deablo</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWqEdYSMo5imnaNixKq4y6KYpqtdo7OtecOrmJ%2BsXWd9c4CMrJqoraSeu6h50Z6nqKqkYrOwvoymoJqlmWK5ow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jack-hughes.html><span>←</span><span>Jack Hughes Wiki, Stats, College, Brother, Height, Age &amp;amp; More</span></a>
