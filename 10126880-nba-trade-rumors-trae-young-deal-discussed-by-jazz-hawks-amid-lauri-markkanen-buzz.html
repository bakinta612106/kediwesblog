Perhaps Utah will ultimately exact a similar offseason to that of Brooklyn, where the Nets once envisioned adding star-level talent alongside Mikal Bridges before determining their best course of action was to enter a rebuild — thanks to a massive haul from New York. The Jazz, as previously reported at Yahoo Sports, were looking into trading for Bridges, held conversations with Atlanta about both Dejounte Murray and Trae Young, sources said, and were working to assemble a group around Markkanen that could have possibly drawn George's eye."</i></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Trade rumors</a> have surrounded Young for quite some time, but the long-rumored breakup of he and Dejounte Murray finally came to fruition with the Hawks dealing the latter player to the New Orleans Pelicans. One can surmise that the chances of Young leaving town now decreased with that move.</p><p>As for Markkanen, he is set to enter free agency after next season, which will see him earn $18 million.</p><p>So the Jazz have a decision to make on his future between coming to terms on a long-term contract extension to keep him in town or trade the 27-year-old to avoid losing him for nothing in free agency.</p><p>Fischer made clear that the Jazz's top priority is re-signing Markkanen, although that hasn't stopped the trade chatter, even if it may be just Utah seeing what it could get out there and fishing for a potential Godfather offer like the New York Knicks just gave the Brooklyn Nets for Mikal Bridges.</p><p><i>"This latest round of Markkanen trade conversations could very well just be the Jazz trying to gather information from interested teams, or an effort to solicit some kind of exorbitant offer akin to the five first-round picks, plus an additional unprotected pick swap from the <a href=# rel=noopener>Knicks</a> for Bridges. The Jazz have so far indicated to various parties around the NBA they would still like to renegotiate and extend Markkanen when the two sides become eligible to do so in August, sources said, and that listening to offers for Markkanen is just part of doing good business."</i></p><p>Teams of course should have interest in Markkanen, who broke out during the 2022-23 season and earned his first All-Star Game honor and the league's Most Improved Player of the Year award.</p><p>Per Fischer, the Golden State Warriors, Sacramento Kings and San Antonio Spurs have been "characterized by league figures with knowledge of the situation as strong possible suitors for Markkanen at this point," with Minnesota showing interest too.</p><p>As for Young, if the Hawks deal him at this point, that means the team is embracing a full rebuild and breakdown. But the rumors on him leaving have died down with Murray now out of town, and it's possible Atlanta just goes forward with a roster reset surrounding him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmuFeXyMp5maZaSnrqWxjKuspqeiqHq1vsCeZLKnpaO0brDEmqNmnJmosLa%2F0p6bZpqpYreixtlmn5qvm6h6ornInWSlmaWntm65wKuipJmemrturtSzsQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10119991-nba-rumors-suns-intend-to-keep-kevin-durant-devin-booker-bradley-beal-for-2024-25.html><span>←</span><span>NBA Rumors: Suns Intend to Keep Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal for 2024-25 | News, Scores,</span></a>
