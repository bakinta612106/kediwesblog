The Golden State Warriors star won best NBA player, best record-breaking performance for most 3-pointers made in league history, and a group trophy for best team for his Golden State Warriors.</p><p>Before he won any awards, though, in his opening monologue, Steph got in a quick dig at LeBron James, making the crowd go crazy.</p><p>“I am the second NBA player to host this awards show, which is kind of crazy to think about,” Curry told the audience. “LeBron James, he hosted this awards show back in 2007 after losing in the NBA Finals. So, yes, you guessed it, this feels better.”</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://twitter.com/espn/status/1549910734041075712?s=20&t=SvJHIue3dyxgIfP5rUwobg</a></p><p>Other winners included Los Angeles Angels star Shohei Ohtani (best athlete, men’s sports), swimmer Katie Ledecky (best athlete, women’s sports), skier Eileen Gu (best breakthrough athlete), Los Angeles Rams star Cooper Kupp (best championship performance), Curry’s Golden State Warriors teammate Klay Thompson (best comeback athlete), soccer star Megan Rapinoe (best play), and St. Louis Cardinals star Albert Pujols (Muhammad Ali Sports Humanitarian Award).</p><p class=gnt_ar_b_p>Thompson dedicated his best comeback win to the late, great Kobe Bryant. After missing back-to-back seasons with separate ACL and Achilles tendon injuries, he won the 2022 NBA championship, thanking Kobe for his will to keep going during the tough times.</p><p class=gnt_ar_b_p>“To Vanessa and her three beautiful girls, we think of Kobe and GiGi every day,” Thompson said during his speech. “I read ‘Mamba Mentality’ every day during rehab. Those were the best memories of my life watching him play. He inspired me to be the athlete I am today.”</p><p>After the Arthur Ashe Courage Award was presented to former boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, Curry took the stage in Brittney Griner’s Phoenix Mercury jersey to raise even more awareness on her tragic situation.</p><p class=gnt_ar_b_p>“We need to acknowledge who isn’t here. Her name is on this jersey,” said Curry, who was joined by Skylar Diggins-Smith, Griner’s Mercury teammate, and the Los Angeles Sparks’ Nneka Ogwumike. “It’s been 153 nights now that BG has been wrongfully detained thousands of miles away from home. Away from her family, away from her friends, away from her team,” Diggins-Smith said.</p><p class=gnt_ar_b_p>Curry added: “We urge the entire global sports community to continue to stay energized of her behalf… she’s one of us, the team of athletes in this room tonight and all over the world. A team that has nothing to do with politics and global conflict.”</p><p>Check out the full list of 2022 ESPYS winners below:</p><p><strong>Best Championship Performance</strong>: Cooper Kupp, Los Angeles Rams</p><p><strong>Best Breakthrough Athlete</strong>: Eileen Gu, Skiing</p><p><strong>Best Athlete, Women’s Sports</strong>: Katie Ledecky</p><p><strong>Best Athlete, Men’s Sports</strong>: Shohei Ohtani, Los Angeles Angels</p><p><strong>Best Record-Breaking Performance</strong>: Stephen Curry most 3-pointers made in NBA history</p><p><strong>Best Play</strong>: Megan Rapinoe Scores from the Corner</p><p><strong>Best Comeback Athlete</strong>: Klay Thompson, Golden State Warriors</p><p><strong>Best Team</strong>: Golden State Warriors</p><p><strong>Pat Tillman Award for Service</strong>: Gretchen Evans</p><p><strong>Jimmy V Award for Perseverance</strong>: Dick Vitale</p><p><strong>Arthur Ashe Award for Courage</strong>: Vitali Klitschko</p><p><strong>Muhammad Ali Sports Humanitarian Award</strong>: Albert Pujols, St. Louis Cardinals</p><p><strong>Billie Jean King Youth Leadership Award</strong>: Noor Abukaram, Kendall Dudley, Sydney Moore, Alicia Serratos, Lucy Westlake</p><p><strong>Best NWSL Player</strong>: Ashley Hatch, Washington Spirit</p><p><strong>Best MLS Playe</strong>r: Carlos Vela, LAFC</p><p><strong>Best Athlete with a Disability, Men’s Sports</strong>: Brad Snyder, Paratriathlon</p><p><strong>Best Athlete with a Disability, Women’s Sports</strong>: Jessica Long, Swimming</p><p><strong>Best Athlete, Men’s Action Sports</strong>: Eli Tomac, Supercross</p><p><strong>Best Athlete, Women’s Action Sports</strong>: Eileen Gu, Skiing</p><p><strong>Best College Athlete, Men’s Sports</strong>: Bryce Young, Alabama Football</p><p><strong>Best College Athlete, Women’s Sports:</strong>&nbsp;Jocelyn Alo, Oklahoma Softball</p><p><strong>Best International Athlete, Men’s Soccer</strong>: Kylian Mbappé, PSG</p><p><strong>Best International Athlete, Women’s Soccer</strong>: Sam Kerr, Chelsea</p><p><strong>Best MLB Player</strong>: Shohei Ohtani, Los Angeles Angels</p><p><strong>Best MMA Fighter</strong>: Charles Oliveira</p><p><strong>Best NBA Player</strong>: Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors</p><p><strong>Best WNBA Player</strong>: Candace Parker, Chicago Sky</p><p><strong>Best NFL Player</strong>: Aaron Rodgers, Green Bay Packers</p><p><strong>Best NHL Player</strong>: Connor McDavid, Edmonton Oilers</p><p><strong>Best Athlete, Men’s Golf</strong>: Justin Thomas</p><p><strong>Best Athlete, Women’s Golf:</strong>&nbsp;Nelly Korda</p><p><strong>Best Athlete, Men’s Tennis</strong>: Rafael Nadal</p><p><strong>Best Athlete, Women’s Tennis</strong>: Emma Raducanu</p><p><strong>Best Bowler</strong>: Kyle Troup</p><p><strong>Best Boxer</strong>: Tyson Fury</p><p><strong>Best Driver</strong>: Kyle Larson, NASCAR</p><p><strong>Best Game</strong>: Kansas City Chiefs defeat the Buffalo Bills in OT</p><p><strong>Best Jockey</strong>: Jose Ortiz</p><p><strong>Best Olympian, Men’s Sports</strong>: Caeleb Dressel, Swimming</p><p><strong>Best Olympian, Women’s Sports</strong>: Katie Ledecky, Swimming</p><p><strong>Best WWE Moment</strong>: Cody Rhodes returns to WWE at Wrestlemania</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOqJmjZZaWuqq42GajoqRdrK66usRmopqllae8r3nCmqmtnaJirrXAxKebZqyYmnpzfJFrZJ6roK7AcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10126880-nba-trade-rumors-trae-young-deal-discussed-by-jazz-hawks-amid-lauri-markkanen-buzz.html><span>←</span><span>NBA Trade Rumors: Trae Young Deal Discussed by Jazz, Hawks amid Lauri Markkanen Buzz | News, Scores,</span></a>
