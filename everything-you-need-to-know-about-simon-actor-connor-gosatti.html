But it utilizes a new cast and a slightly different storyline.&nbsp;</p><p>The series follows Albert Wesker and his daughters Billie and Jade. As Albert moves to <a href=#>New Racoon City</a> to continue developing a drug for Umbrella Corporation, the two girls struggle to adjust to life in their new town.&nbsp;</p><p>Evelyn Marcus is Umbrella Corp.’s ruthless CEO. And despite Albert’s warnings, she launches the T-virus, hoping to profit from it.&nbsp;</p><p>Connor Gosatti plays <a href=#>Evelyn’s son, Simon</a>. He’s one of the few students to befriend Jade and Billie. And he comes through to help Jade figure out what’s happening at Umbrella Corp.&nbsp;</p><h2>‘Resident Evil’ is the actor’s first major project</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p><span>▶</span>” src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/uIdjcDTc9Vk?feature=oembed” frameborder=”0″ allow=”accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></p></figure><p>Gosatti acted in a handful of projects before Resident Evil. He started his career in 2013, appearing in a short titled The Little Astronaut.&nbsp;</p><p>The actor went on to star in several other shorts, including All in the Hood, Shine Bright, Midnight Ticket, and No Bus.</p><p>Gosatti also had roles in the 2017 movie 3rd Night and the <a href=#>TV</a> series What We See.&nbsp;</p><h2>Connor Gosatti: Age, girlfriend, nationality, Instagram, and more</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Resident-Evil-Netflix-cast-Connor-Gosatti-Siena-Agudong.jpg><p>Gosatti was born on Jan. 2, 2002, in Perth, Australia. In a recent interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Out Loud Culture</a>, he revealed he took acting classes as a kid and appeared in local theater productions. He’s also a multi-talented performer whose early love of music resulted in his learning to play the guitar, drums, and piano.&nbsp;</p><p>The actor still lives in Perth. And according to his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>, he’s in a romantic relationship with his Resident Evil co-star Siena Agudong, who plays Billie Wesker.&nbsp;</p><p>Gosatti doesn’t have any publicly announced projects in the pipeline. But he hopes to continue perfecting his craft and pursuing his career.&nbsp;</p><p>“Honestly, I’m just taking things day by day,” he said. “I’ve been blessed with the opportunity to work with high-grade members in the industry and get a solid foot in the door. Now it’s just about continuing to build the craft and waiting for the next opportunity to arise.”&nbsp;</p><p>When speaking of his experience working on Resident Evil, Gosatti added, “Fortunately, this project has made me realize that, for one, I’m capable of doing this, and, for two, show me what the industry is like at that level. I won’t lie — it’s incredibly daunting. However, I’ve learned now, and it’s important to note that you can’t control the ocean; you just gotta ride the wave. That’s what I plan on doing.”</p><p>Resident Evil is streaming on Netflix.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RELATED: <strong><a href=#>‘Resident Evil’ Netflix Cast: Everything to Know About Young Jade Wesker Actor Tamara Smart</a></strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOnq2eqqmptaq6xmawqK1do7KmsIytpmajnqTEbq3BqKytZaOeurC6jJqaraeiYrCwus2oqWafn6iutcDIaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sophie-ostroy-wikipedia-adrienne-shelly-daughter-age-where-is-she-now-in-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Erica Ifill Age And Wikipedia: Where Is She From?
