Griffo was elected as mayor of his home town from Rome, NY in 1991 and won the city’s subsequent elections in the year 1995 and 1999.</p><p>Griffo was instrumental in bringing Woodstock 1999 to Rome; this effort earned him the nickname “The Rock N’ Roll Mayor.” The concert was held at the deserted Griffiss Air Force Base and served as a precedent to using the space for future concerts and events. Woodstock ’99 attracted over 200,000 people. The event was largely successful until the final day, when the audience–encouraged by the performing band–began making bonfires. As the crowd got out of control, state troopers and local police dispersed the crowd without further incident.</p><p>Griffo was appointed Oneida County Executive in June 2003 to serve out the term of his predecessor. Griffo was then elected to the post in November 2003. After raising taxes 16% for 2003, his predecessor had announced that taxes for 2004 might need to be raised by as much as 26% due to skyrocketing Medicare costs and retirement benefits. However, after Griffo was appointed County Executive, he was able to balance the 2004 budget while raising taxes by 2.9%. In 2005, he implemented a prescription drug plan that cut drug costs for Oneida county residents by up to 38%.</p><p align=justify>Griffo was a member of the Oneida County Legislature from 1989 to 1991.</p><p align=justify>Griffo was detained in the early hours of August 1st, 1988 for being accused of serving alcohol or allowing the serving of alcohol for minors at a gathering that he hosted.&nbsp;The case was dismissed on the possibility of dismissal.&nbsp;After his arrest Griffo claimed that the police officer who was in charge of his arrest of being “disgruntled” even though being adamant about the Rome Police having legitimate grounds to warrant an arrest.&nbsp;Then, the Rome Democratic Party employed lawyer Robert Abrams to probe into Rome Judge James Kehoe’s decision on charges against Joseph Griffo.</p><p align=justify>As Mayor, Griffo eliminated Rome’s special one-quarter percent sales tax. Also, Griffo “was able to prevent a tax hike there (Rome) in all but one of his years in office, despite the crippling loss of Griffiss Air Force Base in 1993 – perhaps the worst single economic blow the county has ever seen.” Griffo merged the parks and recreation departments and handed over the city’s weights and measures and emergency management departments to the county, resulting in savings. To prevent closures and service cuts, he privatized Rome Hospital, the Erie Canal Village, and city trash collection services.</p><h2>Joseph Griffo Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Joseph is one of the <strong>richest Politician</strong> from United States.

In 2011, he voted against the Marriage Equality Act, which the Senate passed 33-29.</p><p>On January 3, 2017, Griffo drew media attention for a sharp and contentious Twitter exchange with Melissa DeRosa, Chief of Staff to New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo.</p><h2>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h2><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Joseph Griffo ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Normally, sales tax revenues are split amongst state, county and townships/cities. However, in order to cover mandated Medicaid costs, the 1.5% increase would all go to the county government. Utica Mayor Tim Julian began claiming a share of the revenues. Griffo remained adamant in refusing to split the revenues. Griffo tried to disarm the situation by offering the city of Utica $800,000 in debt forgiveness, which Julian refused. Griffo eventually won out and the county did not split the extra sales tax revenues with Utica.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Joseph Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Politician</strong>.
