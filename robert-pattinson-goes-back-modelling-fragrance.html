In fact, his modelling work started decreasing within four years of his stepping into this line.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/pattinson-re-enters-world-of-modelling-through-new-fragrance-campaign-06-1024x576.jpg alt="Pattinson Re-Enters World of Modelling Through New Fragrance Campaign 6" width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Pattinson has himself accepted the fact that his career as a model was not a very fortunate one. Though he loved modelling and blamed the lack of it on his masculine appearance. Interestingly, during his modelling days the androgynous look was “in fashion”. Thus, he being tall and lean with long locks fitted very well with the criteria. But as time passed and he started adapting a more masculine look for his physical appearance, his modelling work decreased. In 2013, he was roped in for a modelling shoot for the House of Dior Homme Fragrance.</p><p>But the good news for all the Robert Pattinson fans is that he is back yet again in another House of Dior Fragrance campaigns in his model avatar. Pattinson was seen striking modelling poses and pouting for this monochrome campaign shot in New York City. The slogan for this campaign which reads “Dream as if you will live forever” matches very well with Pattinson’s role in Twilight. It &nbsp;has been shot by Peter Lindbergh and has managed to capture Robert in yet another manly shoot. Pattinson has always remained a heartthrob and a fashion statement for his fans and audience. This campaign would only elevate his fashion sense and photogenic looks in the eyes of his audiences.</p><p>Do you like the model in Pattinson? Would you prefer him to go in for more modelling shoot?
