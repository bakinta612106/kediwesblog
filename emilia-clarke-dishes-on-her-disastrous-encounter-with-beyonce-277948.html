The 32-year-old appeared on Jimmy Kimmel’s show last night to talk about Game Of Thrones, alluding to the episode, “The Long Night.”</p><p>While at an Academy Awards afterparty, Emilia found out Beyonce was there and she was a big fan of the show. In the video clip below, you can see Emilia describe the story in detail.</p><p>During the interaction, Clarke began, there was a moment where she might’ve made the weirdest noise She said, “I think I started crying, exactly that noise came out of my mouth,” and Bey suddenly acted like the conversation became incredibly awkward and she had to leave.</p><p></p><p>Emilia went on to say that she’s a huge fan of Beyonce Knowles, and it breaks her heart because she messed up her chance at meeting her. As you may know, Beyonce is a big favorite among people in the entertainment industry, with stars and musicians frequently capitulating to the former Destiny’s Child member.</p><p>The last star to admit a cringe-worthy story about meeting Beyonce was Tiffany Haddish, who admitted to starting a fight with another Hollywood actress who supposedly bit Beyoncé’s face. Beyoncé was doing her best to calm Tiffany down, and Haddish told her she would relax only if Bey took a picture.</p><p>In the photo, Beyonce hides her face ever-so-slight while Tiffany smiles in the picture. Leslie Jones, as well, took a picture with Beyonce one time and wrote in the caption, “I was so nervous.” Cringe-worthy capitulation or not, Beyonce performed at Coachella last year and since then, her star power has only grown.</p><p>Moreover, the birth of her two twins with her husband, Jay-Z – Rumi Carter, and Sir Carter – saw the singer propelled to the position of holding the Instagram record for most likes.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Interestingly, Emilia has every right to feel more than equal to Beyonce, considering she has a starring role on one of the most successful TV series of all time.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeVorattcBmmqWZoqCybrDIrJ%2Beq12ku260xKtknaGjlsC1vs6uqmadnpi8trrTnqlmr5mptW6uxLKmp5uVYn94g5htb2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dried-grass-used-as-fodder-html.html><span>←</span><span>Dried grass used as fodder</span></a>
