Victoria then tries to explain that the upcoming commercial is a very big deal before David interrupts her again, asking his wife to explain exactly where and when the spot is set to air (at which point, she informs him that she’s trying to do just that despite his constant asides). Suddenly, Victoria’s attempts to explain their future commercial go hilariously awry when she says the ad will air during a “baseball game.”</p><p>“The super big baseball game,” David responds, as Victoria shoots back, “Or was it the hockey bowl?”</p><p>“Hockey bowl,” David clarifies. “Oh, and tell them about Jessica Aniston,” David quips, as Victoria says that, yes, “Jessica Aniston” will be in it. The commercial closes with text from the Beckhams’ sponsor: “Whatever you forget this Sunday, remember Uber Eats.”</p><p>Lots of companies are using ads&nbsp;for their Super Bowl ads to get consumers pumped up for the ones that air during the big game, and they’re also leaning into viral memes and jokes. Hellmann’s, a popular mayonnaise ad, has been advertising their upcoming Super Bowl ad featuring “Saturday Night Live” alumni Kate McKinnon and Pete Davidson, who learn that not only can McKinnon’s cat talk, but she’s dated Davidson.</p><p>Super Bowl LVIII will air on CBS on February 11.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnlJbDqrCMnKmoq5KueqK6w2abq52nYq%2BivtGypKiqlah6s7HLmquip56otaq8jJ6vqaSRnrumsI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ten-commandments-recipient-html.html><span>←</span><span>Ten Commandments recipient</span></a>
