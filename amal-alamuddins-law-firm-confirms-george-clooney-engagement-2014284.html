And Robin Jackson, chief executive of her law firm, told Reuters, "She brings a bright light to everything she is involved in, and I am so delighted at her happy news."</p><p>As previously reported, the Oscar-winning bachelor, 52, popped the question to Alamuddin, 36, sometime in the past two weeks. The proposal followed a whirlwind romance; the couple were first spotted out together in October 2013, when he was still dating model <strong>Monika Jakisic</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"It's actually not that surprising. He likes a woman with brains and class," a source told <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> of the engagement news. "She's the full package…He's happy and found his ideal match. He didn't settle, so good for him."</p><p>Added another insider: "This is the healthiest relationship I've ever seen George in. He seems incredibly happy, and Amal is such a sweet and intelligent girl who has her own thoughts and ideas and doesn't just bow down to everything he says."</p><p>Clooney was previously wed to actress <strong>Talia Balsam</strong> from 1989 to 1993. He has also famously romanced <strong>Lisa Snowdon</strong>, <strong>Elisabetta Canalis</strong>, and <a href=#><strong>Stacy Keibler</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJimmZxirq2tzK6bnaGeqHqtrdZmnaKqnWKwsLrFoqmmq12csrC%2Bxp5knKSfpLumxYyepaCZl5q6prrTZmlpaWRnhXU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-line-has-a-slope-of-7-and-a-y-intercept-of-4-what-is-its-equation-in-slope-intercept-form-2765.html><span>←</span><span>A line has a slope of 7 and a y-intercept of -4.
