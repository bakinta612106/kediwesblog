During Wednesday's edition of NFL Live (via Awful Announcing), Schefter affirmed that Higgins is &#34;pissed&#34; when colleague Marcus Spears speculated as much.
That followed a discussion between Schefter and Dan Orlovsky about whether the fifth-year pass-catcher could make a &#34;business decision&#34; midway through the 2024 season to preserve his health."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Given the extent to which the receiver market is booming, you can't blame the 25-year-old for seeking a bigger payday.</p><p>When it comes to ongoing negotiations, it doesn't appear Cincinnati is willing to meet Higgins halfway or anywhere in between.</p><p>The <i>Cincinnati Enquirer</i>'s <a href=# rel=noopener>Kelsey Conway</a> reported in April the 2020 second-round pick was looking to get a contract that broadly aligns with the <a href=# rel=noopener>three-year, $70 million</a> pact Michael Pittman Jr. signed with the Indianapolis Colts. The Bengals haven't come close to that figure, though.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Jeremy Fowler</a> of ESPN also reported in April the team has signaled it has "no plans" of trading Higgins, which aligns with how the front office and ownership have approached similar situations in the past.</p><p>Jessie Bates III played out the 2022 season on the franchise tag before leaving as a free agent. Jonah Williams also had to <a href=# rel=noopener>take back</a> his trade request when it became clear Cincinnati wasn't moving him last offseason.</p><p>Higgins has <a href=# rel=noopener>said publicly</a> he expects to suit up for the Bengals. At the end of the day, he stands to lose too much by actually sitting out an entire year.</p><p>But Schefter raised an important point about how Higgins' lingering discontent might manifest down the road.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmZ%2Fd4OMrJqhnZapsrN5wZ6loJmcqHq1scRmn6Kfl567tHnIrGSpoaOosqV5zp%2BdZpmdnrFur86nq6uZk6l6r7LLZqurmZSaerPBzKiprA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sage-the-gemini.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Sage The Gemini</span></a>
