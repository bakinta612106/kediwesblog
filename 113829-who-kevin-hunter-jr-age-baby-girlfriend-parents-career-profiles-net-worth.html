Is Kevin Hunter Jr. Wendy Williams biological son? Yes. Samuel is the only son of talk show host Wendy Williams, who had several miscarriages before conceiving him. His father, Hunter Sr., is a Black <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Canadian-American</a> executive producer, businessman, and public figure.</p><p class=align-left>Samuel grew up in New Jersey. Although he is Wendy’s only child, his father, Wendy's second husband until January 2020, had a daughter with his mistress, massage therapist Sharina Hudson, which was one of the reasons her mother filed for a <a href=#>divorce</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Wendy Williams is currently going through a tough time with her health, and Samuel has had to spend time with her during his free time. He is extremely close to his mother, which was on full display on her Instagram and photos online.</p><h3>Kevin Hunter Jr.'s education</h3><p class=align-left>Samuel attended high school in New Jersey and graduated in 2018. Kevin Hunter Jr.'s college education is in <a id=https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a35354281/wendy-williams-son-kevin-hunter-jr/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Miami,</a> Florida, but information on the specific institution is not public.</p><h3>What does Kevin Hunter Jr. do for a living?</h3><p class=align-left>Wendy's son is still in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">school</a> and is not actively employed. His life is low-key since he does not post regularly. He is only active on Instagram, with posts showing his mother, friends, and a picture with <a href=#>music</a> mogul Diddy. Judging from his posts, Samuel seems not to have a girlfriend or children that we know of.</p><h3>What happened to Wendy Williams' son?</h3><p class=align-left>Similar to his mother, Hunter Jr. struggled with addiction. He was addicted to K2, a form of synthetic marijuana, during his early teenage years. Wendy and her ex-husband started the Hunter Foundation in 2014, and the experience with their son deepened its life mission to help youths live healthy, drug-free lives through public awareness.</p><h3>What did Kevin Hunter Jr. do?</h3><p class=align-left>In May 2019, Wendy's son got arrested on alleged assault charges. He allegedly punched his father on the nose outside of a food store in West Orange, New Jersey. Hunter Jr. took a plea of not guilty to the charges, and the case was dropped. His dad stated that he did not want his son to have any legal troubles.</p><h3>Kevin Hunter Jr.'s net worth</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/49122081bf8e20f7.jpg><p class=align-left>Samuel, being a student with no known employment history, makes it hard to estimate Kevin Hunter Jr.'s 2021 net worth. However, he is about <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$7.5 million</a> rich, according to Idol Net Worth. He enjoys a comfortable life from his parents' wealth considering that Wendy Williams' net worth alone is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$40 million</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Kevin Hunter Jr. is known because of his parents' fame. Will he make a career in the <a href=#>entertainment</a> industry? Only time will tell. We wish him all the best in his studies and future endeavours.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: <a href=#>Chief Keef: net worth, age, children, parents, height, real name, profiles</a></p><p class=align-left><a href=#>We </a>published <a href=#>Chief Keef's biography</a>.
