A powerful Shomrim leader has been indicted in Brooklyn federal court for the alleged rape of a 15-year-old girl, authorities announced Thursday.
Jacob “Yanky” Daskal, 62, was charged in 2018 in state court for the alleged sexual abuse of the same girl — but federal prosecutors have stepped in and brought a new case against him, court records shows. Federal officials declined to comment on why they’re also pursuing Daskal, who founded the Borough Park Shomrim — a private, Orthodox Jewish crime-patrol group associated with the NYPD’s 66th Precinct — some 30 years ago.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Sir Anthony Ritossa Outlines Family Business Considerations for 2023</h2><time>Aug 13, 2024</time>

Possibly the truest spoken statement about boxing.
