Travis Barker has added yet another new tattoo to his vast collection —&nbsp;and this time, the design has nothing to do with his girlfriend, Kourtney Kardashian.
On Thursday, the 45-year-old Blink-182 drummer posted a video of his fresh ink by celebrity tattoo artist Ganga: the words “survivor’s guilt” on the crook of each of his arms.
Though Barker didn’t comment on the significance of the tattoo, it seems to be a reference to the 2008 plane crash that left the star&nbsp;with burns covering 65 percent of his body, severely injured his friend Adam “DJ AM” Goldstein and killed four other people on board.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>VISTA chat about new single 'Born For Blood'</h2><time>Aug 30, 2024</time>
