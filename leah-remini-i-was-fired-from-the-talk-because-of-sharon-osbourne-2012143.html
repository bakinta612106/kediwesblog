"Sharon thought me and Holly were 'ghetto'. . . we were not funny, awkward and didn't know ourselves," Remini, 41, tweeted. "She has the power that was given to her."</p><p>PHOTOS: Celebrity feuds — whose side are you on?</p><p>(Remini was tweeting in response to a radio interview Osbourne had done with <strong>Howard Stern</strong>, 58.)</p><p>Osbourne denied Remini's claims via <a href=#>Twitter</a> Tuesday, saying: "In response to Leah Remini's continuous comments that I had her fired from The Talk, let me just go on the record to say I had absolutely nothing to do with her departure from the show and have no idea why she continues to take to Twitter to spread this false gossip."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Leah knows that I have never been in the position to hire or fire anyone on the show," Osbourne <a href=#>added</a>. "That being said, my only wish is that Leah would just stop all this negative, unprofessional and childish behavior. It's been seven months. . .it's time to move on. Leah is a very talented actress and I only wish her happiness and success."</p><p>She <a href=#>concluded</a>: "I know that better things are to come if she can just get beyond all this negativity."</p><p>Remini didn't stop tweeting, though. On Wednesday, she <a href=#>argued</a> that Osbourne "just wants publicity out of this" and said she has no intention of keeping quiet. "If someone wants me to stop, they should call a lawyer and tell them what I am NOT telling the truth about," Remini <a href=#>told</a> her followers. "We can go from there."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKOemZhiv6a5yKegZqFdrK60ecWiqZ6cXZu%2FsLmMrZ%2BeZaSWuax5wZ6amq2jmnqwsoysn5qqn6N6sL%2FBqKyrppVif3F9kWprbA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./king-of-the-jungle-html.html><span>←</span><span>King of the jungle</span></a>
