(opens in a new tab)" href=#>Stevie J.’</a></strong>s home, a music producer they were both in a relationship with at the same time without knowing so. Hernandez greeted Faust by saying, “Hey, maid, I see you got on your maid outfit like you always do.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-503628360-scaled.jpg><p>Although Faust didn’t comment on Hernandez’s current post, she did admit to VH1 in a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="recent interview (opens in a new tab)" href=#>recent interview</a> that the “hey, maid” scene with Hernandez still bothered her, considering that she didn’t know Stevie J. was cheating on her with Hernandez.</p><p>“That was the worst part about it, is that it was on TV,” Faust said. “If you go through something with your significant other and he’s cheating on you, and it’s just you three going through it and maybe your girlfriends knowing about it — but to go through that and the whole f–kin’ world knows about it and everybody has an opinion? I was at that point ‘the stupidest,’ ‘you’re a doormat,’ you’re this, you’re that. From an audience perspective, I guess that’s how they’re looking at it. They thought because this is TV I know what’s going on. I had no f–kin’ clue. And then everybody wants to ask me why the f–k am I so angry. Are you f–kin’ kidding me? Would you not be angry if this was happening to you.”</p><p>Both Hernandez and Faust have moved on from that past love triangle. Hernandez shares 3-year-old Bonnie Bella with Stevie and Faust has 10-year-old daughter Eva Giselle with him also. The music producer <a href=#>co-parents </a>well with both women. Hernandez and Faust, however, seemed to still have a shaky relationship with each other.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9xe49tZmlsX52yusWMppiinF2fvLSxy6KlnmWYmr%2Bvrc2dnLNllpa7tHnBnqOinaaaerS0xKxkraCipMSqusZmqqGZlJp6osCMpqCmoV2brra%2F02agp2Wknba0ec%2Boqq1n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./heres-how-you-went-to-the-bathroom-in-medieval-castles.html><span>←</span><span>Here's How You Went To The Bathroom In Medieval Castles</span></a>
