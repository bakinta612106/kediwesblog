In a TikTok video, she said her loved ones and time spent filming for “Reno 911!” helped her through. “My love JB [Jessica Betts] was my rock,” said Nash. “I was also filming Reno [911!] at the same time. My daughter Dia is funny and was a bright light who brought me joy on set & my girl Cardi B!”</p><p>On Instagram, Nash wrote, “Dahmer was my most challenging job to date…. Had to lean into my joy HARD during the filming process.” Her fans applauded her performance. One person wrote, “You were AMAZING in that movie! You hear me???!! A freakin mazing! baby girl too!” And a second commented, “You are awesome I was wondering the same thing how did you do it!!!” But the series has also been<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> on the receiving end of flak</a>.</p><p>Several victims’ family members have expressed similar outrage and disappointment in the series, some of whom said it was retraumatizing. “I was never contacted about the show. I feel like Netflix should’ve asked if we mind or how we felt about making it. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">They</a> didn’t ask me anything. They just did it,” Rita Isbell, sister of Dahmer’s victim, Errol Lindsey, told Insider. In the series, Isbell’s emotional delivery of her victim impact statement is reenacted.&nbsp;</p><p>Across social media, people also condemned the show’s creator, Ryan Murphy, and Netflix.&nbsp;</p><p>“Reminder Jeffrey Dahmer was a racist, a pdfile, a serial killer and cannibalist. The show was made against the families pleas, and Netflix & Ryan Murphy profited GREATLY off reenacting the trauma those victims and their families went through along with the black community.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Reminder Jeffrey Dahmer was a racist, a pdfile, a serial killer and cannibalist.
