Keuchel is currently on a minor league deal and has accumulated a 3.93 ERA in Triple-A ball, although he's recorded an impressive 1.61 ERA in his past five starts (h/t <a href=# rel=noopener>Curt Hogg</a> of the <i>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</i>).</p><p>Keuchel established himself as one of the top pitchers in the majors shortly after his debut season with the Houston Astros in 2012, earning an American League Cy Young Award and winning 20 games as a starter for the Astros in 2015.</p><p>He was unable to stay in one location as he entered his 30s, suiting up in games with four separate teams since the 2021 season. His last MLB appearance was in 2023, when he played in 10 games for the Minnesota Twins while making six starts.</p><p>Keuchel struggled with the Twins, posting a 5.97 ERA and allowing 45 hits in 37.2 innings. The 36-year-old also racked up just 25 strikeouts compared to 18 walks.</p><p>While his All-Star days appear to be behind him, he may be able to provide some valuable rotation depth after stringing together some promising starts in the minors. The Brewers have dealt with several injuries to pitchers, currently ranking No. 18 among all teams with an average ERA of 4.20 among starters (via <a href=# rel=noopener>MLB.com</a>).</p><p>Right-hander Brandon Woodruff won't pitch in 2024 after undergoing shoulder surgery in Oct. 2023, while lefty Wade Miley underwent Tommy John surgery in May. Rookie Robert Grasser's season also came to an end due to elbow <a href=# rel=noopener>surgery</a> on Monday.</p><p>As the Brewers attempt to maintain their five-game lead in the NL Central, Keuchel could become a potential depth option.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmt9coSMpqObZaKqurC%2B0mabmqSclsBut8SumqGdnGLBs63DnptmrJ9ir7Ox1p6prGWWp7yuecyaqaKmlafAbrLOq6Seql2WuW6v2GawqK2enHq4tc2nnKs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miles-luna-wiki-bio-girlfriend-dating-ellie-married-net-worth-family.html><span>←</span><span>Miles Luna Wiki Bio, girlfriend, dating Ellie, married, net worth, family</span></a>
