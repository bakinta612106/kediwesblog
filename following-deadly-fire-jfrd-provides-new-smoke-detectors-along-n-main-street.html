A new position was just created in the fire department to implement more safety programs like this. Fire Chief Keith Powers says it’s saving lives.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 cynzxG">“The smoke detectors give you an early warning that something is going on long before the smoke overcomes you in the house,” Powers explained.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 cynzxG">And you don’t have to be in an area where they’re actually walking through the neighborhoods.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 cynzxG">If you have questions about smoke detectors, or if you need one, you can contact the fire department or the city at 630-CITY.
