The highly anticipated arrival of Girl Meets World (a dream come true for fans of Cory and Topanga) premiers tonight on the Disney Channel at 9:45 EST. The show follows childhood sweethearts Cory and Topanga as they navigate adulthood, marriage and children of their own.</p><p>Ben Savage and Danielle Fishel both took a break from acting to pursue their college degrees, but they are back now playing the roles that shot them to stardom in the early 90s. The longtime friends recently took a break from shooting their new sitcom to talk to reporters about reprising their roles as everyone’s favorite childhood sweethearts and what it’s been like being Cory and Topanga for 21 years – even with a long break in between.</p><p>“If I didn’t talk to Danielle for a year, we’d pick up right where we left off. You spend so much time growing up with someone, there’s a level of comfort,” Savage, who plays Cory, says of his longtime friend and onscreen love, Fishel. It’s difficult not to remain friends after so long when you spend years working on set and share your first kiss with your costar.</p><p>Though the stars never expected to come back to television as their former television selves, they understand fans desire to see them again. The fans have consistently recognized both actors as their television personalities for as long as they can remember. In fact, Fishel stated she was recently surprised when a fan approached her and used her real name instead of Topanga, as she’s grown accustomed to over the years.</p><p>Fans of the show can form their own opinion tonight over whether or not the wait was worth it to see the child stars grow up, wed, and have kids of their own. Given their childhood antics, it might be fun to watch the couple’s new television children.</p><p>(Photo by Brian Ach/Getty Images for Moet &amp;amp; Chandon)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiZqLGjYrqmsdOsZLCnoqGxbq7AnKJmrKeewLV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./birds-of-paradise-on-amazon-is-a-tragic-queer-love-story-for-the-ages.html><span>←</span><span>Birds of Paradise on Amazon Is a Tragic Queer Love Story for the Ages</span></a>
