Particularly, his fans want to know if Jamie Oliver has musical talents too and if he can sing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Though Jamie Oliver has been in a few songs for promotional reasons, he says he is not </strong><a href=# class=rank-math-link rel=noopener><strong>a singer.</strong></a><strong> Though he is multi-talented, it turns out singing is not one of Jamie Oliver’s talents. That does not stop him from trying though as there are multiple videos out of him attempting to sing.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Continue reading to find out what songs Jamie Oliver has done and why he doesn’t consider himself a singer.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Food Revolution Day</h2><p>In 2015, Jamie Oliver released a song to promote <a href=# rel=noopener>Food Revolution Day</a>. Food Revolution Day is on May 15th.&nbsp;</p><p>It is a global day created by Jamie Oliver meant to <a href=# rel=noopener>emphasize the growing issue of obesity</a> in the world and what we can do to stop it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Jamie wants the day to be about <a href=# rel=noopener>bringing awareness and education</a> to people to help them realize that obesity is a problem everywhere and what food we eat is important in helping combat that.&nbsp;</p><p>To promote the day, <a href=# rel=noopener>Jamie Oliver released</a> a video of him rapping alongside various celebrities. The video starts with Jamie Oliver and singer Ed Sheeran playing guitar.&nbsp;</p><p>Jamie Oliver surprises everyone by rapping, then singer Paul McCartney makes an appearance, simply strumming a guitar and saying “revolution” repeatedly. Actor Hugh Jackman later makes an appearance as well to perform some spoken word.</p><p>A verse from Jamie Oliver’s rap is: “Half the world is starving with too little to eat and the other half the world die for being obese.”</p><p>Jamie has since said that he didn’t want to be on the song because he didn’t want it to be bad. <a href=# rel=noopener>He says</a>, “I’m not a singer and I’m certainly not a rapper.”&nbsp;</p><p>He did end up doing it though as the message the video is promoting is important to him. The video features a link to the petition at the end for everyone to get involved.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Other Singing Endeavors&nbsp;</h2><p>Despite Jamie Oliver saying he is not a singer, his song for Food Revolution Day was not the first time he has sung or rapped publicly.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2014, <a href=# rel=noopener>Jamie Oliver and Taylor Swift paired up</a> to create parody to her song “Shake it Off”. They titled the parody “Bake it Off”. The parody was meant to benefit the charity organization <a href=# rel=noopener>Stand Up to Cancer</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Jamie Oliver has also not only created parody songs, but he also has an entire song about Lamb Curry.&nbsp;</p><p>When he used to go on tour to do food cooking demos, songwriter and composer <a href=# rel=noopener>Leigh Haggerwood</a> created a song for Jamie.&nbsp;</p><p>The song was meant to be for his Happy Days Live Tour and is titled <a href=# rel=noopener>Lamb Curry Song.</a> It is quite catchy, but Jamie is right when he says he is not a singer. The song is meant to be humorous, so it is pretty out of tune.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the lyrics are: “Lamb Curry, you give it to me hot. Ain’t no worries when you cook it from your heart.”&nbsp;</p><p>It goes on to teach people how to make lamb curry: “Give ‘em a pulse to make some sauce, lovely, lovely sauce. Now find a tin of coconut milk and open it up”.&nbsp;</p><p>While the song did not win any awards, his fans seemed to enjoy it. It is also quite an informative song as it sings the whole recipe for making lamb curry.</p><p>Jamie would couple the song with a live demonstration on cooking the lamb curry while on tour.&nbsp;</p><p>So, although Jamie Oliver says he is not a singer, he does have a good amount of songs out, typically for charity or for his cooking shows.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jpyYp2WalrqqsYyoo6Kulad6tLXNoGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./beyonces-father-gets-mad-and-leaves-interview-after-chloe-bailey-is-compared-to-his-daughter-says-its-insulting-and-more-479606.html><span>←</span><span>Beyonces Father Gets Mad And Leaves Interview After Chloe Bailey Is Compared To His Daughter</span></a>
