However, the singer later returned to her platform to clap back at the haters, telling them to ‘stop reaching!’</p><p>It all started immediately after Taylor was honored with the Video of the Year award at the Video Music Awards!</p><p>Demi posted a story on her IG that read: ‘I skipped the VMA’s for a REASON.’</p><p>As you can imagine, the timing of her post made it seem like she was shading Taylor Swift.</p><p>However, Demi made it very clear that it was never her intention to attack the fellow singer.</p><p>So, she followed up her original message with one in which she defended herself and cleared things up.</p><p>‘Btw… I did not ‘shade’ anyone last night. My REASON for not going is because I am literally living my dream being on Will and Grace rn so stop reaching thaaaannnkksss,’ she wrote.</p><p>But that was not the end of it! Taylor’s fans were not convinced since some tweeted things like: ‘Why do Demi Lovato stans cry about Taylor being petty when Demi’s ALWAYS publicly doing s**t like this?’ / ‘Any of you lovatics try to defend demi f***ing stop. she doesn’t support women. she hates taylor swift for god knows what reason, thinks you’re not homophobic if you know someone gay, and overall is a s**t person. i’m tired of her pulling this s**t and being excused.’</p><p>It totally sounds like Demi denied shading Taylor on her IG story even though she never mentioned her name but it makes sense why people would think she did.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The timing is part of the reason why, but then again, she also sided with her manager, Scooter Braun, amid his and Taylor’s beef as well!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUmrqqecuorZqsn2LBprjLrGStmamhvLN50rCgn6xdm66vv4ytpmarpKS9br7EmpqhoZ6ceqKy056pZqyYmsZurcKcrKydXZ2ys3nOn2SsoJGZtq%2BzjK2fnqGiYralu8tmoKdlnprEbrzOrKtma2Fqf3mCjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./damilola-adegbite.html><span>←</span><span>Damilola Adegbite Biography and Other Facts About the Nigerian Actress</span></a>
