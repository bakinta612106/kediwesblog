They all got glammed up for a night out at the Caudwell Children Butterfly Ball in London.
Peter and Junior seemed to have compared notes, appearing in matching black and red suits.
And Princess, Peter’s daughter with ex Kate Price, matched her step-mum in a red gown.
The teenager was again wearing make-up – days after hitting back at followers who criticised her for a snap she posted from a family wedding."><meta name=author content="Patria Henriques"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
