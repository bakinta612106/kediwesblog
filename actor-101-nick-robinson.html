Nick then signed with The Savage Agency in LA; unfortunately, the 2007-2008 Writer’s Guild of America strike was in full swing so he and his parents returned to Washington.</p><p>In 2009, he landed the role of Ryder Scanlon on ABC Family sitcom, Melissa and Joey. He played the role until the show concluded back in 2015. In 2011, he went on a hiatus from the show where he began filming for the Disney Channel original, Frenemies.

As well as starring in an episode of Boardwalk Empire as Rowland Smith, a young thief.</p><p>In late 2013, Nick Robinson was cast in Jurassic World, the fourth instalment of the Jurassic Park franchise. He co-starred with Ty Simpkins, playing a pair of brothers who go and visit their aunt at Jurassic World. The movie then became the second highest grossing film of 2015.</p><p>He then played Ben Parish in the film adaption of The 5th Wave, which was released in January 2016. Nick Robinson’s appearances in both Jurassic World and The 5th Wave resulted in his character being written out of Melissa and Joey for multiple episodes of the final season. Although, he made a few appearances and returned for the final three episodes.</p><p>In 2016, it was announced he would star in the comedy-drama, Krystal. As well as being announced he would play Olly in the film adaptation of Everything Everything.</p><h4>Social Media Links:</h4><p><a href=#>Twitter</a> – <a href=#>Instagram</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51krqTAzqtkamhhYruqr8pmqaiamaPAsLqO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./salams-houda-benyamina-on-helping-diams-tell-her-story.html><span>←</span><span>'Salam's' Houda Benyamina on Helping Diam's Tell Her Story</span></a>
