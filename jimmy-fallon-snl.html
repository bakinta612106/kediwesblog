<span>Kelle Repass</span></p><h1>Why Did Jimmy Fallon Leave SNL? Was He Fired?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Jimmy Fallon gained notoriety on “Saturday Night Live” for his superb celebrity impersonations. According to him, “I was becoming more and more famous, and more people were talking about the show.” He mentioned former cast members Chris Farley, Molly Shannon, and Tina Fey, saying that the show has distinct times where cast members begin to be recognized for their talent. So, he continued, “I believe it was probably my moment.”</p><p>Fallon was adored by the audience for his impressions, humor, and good looks. Jonathan Bennett, who plays Aaron Samuels in “Mean Girls,” acknowledged that Tina Fey chose him for the role because she believed he resembled the late-night talk show host. Bennett told HuffPost, “She said that’s precisely 100 percent true.”</p><p>Fallon, meanwhile, didn’t see himself staying on “SNL” for the long haul. He made an exit announcement from the well-known sketch comedy program in 2004. Even though Fallon currently has his own late-night program, he once had other lofty ambitions in the entertainment business.</p><h3>Jimmy Fallon was an aspiring actor before his late-night show</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/jimmy-fallon-was-an-aspiring-actor-turned-late-night-talk-show-host-1671823693.jpg alt="jimmy fallon snl audition,jimmy fallon young,jimmy fallon snl skits,jimmy fallon snl characters,jimmy fallon snl 1998,jimmy fallon wife,jimmy fallon snl years,jimmy fallon snl christmas song,jimmy fallon snl it guy,jimmy fallon snl christmas opening,jimmy fallon snl host,jimmy fallon snl cast,jimmy fallon snl christmas monologue,justin timberlake and jimmy fallon snl,best of jimmy fallon snl,will ferrell jimmy fallon snl,best jimmy fallon snl skits,justin timberlake jimmy fallon snl family feud,harry styles jimmy fallon snl,jerry seinfeld jimmy fallon snl,debbie downer jimmy fallon snl" width=546 height=307 sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Read More: https://www.nickiswift.com/1148498/heres-why-jimmy-fallon-really-left-snl/Jimmy Fallon had his sights set on becoming an actor when he left “Saturday Night Live,” following in the footsteps of “SNL” veterans Chevy Chase and Eddie Murphy.<br>In an interview with <a href=#>Entrepreneur</a>, he said, “My objective was just to be in movies — be like a rom-com guy or anything.” Afterward, he said that he had believed it was what he was expected to do after performing well during the live sketch show. He said, “It’s just the path.”</p><p>Following his tenure on “SNL,” Fallon had a few acting roles, including “Taxi” with Queen Latifah and “Fever Pitch” with Drew Barrymore. But those acting aspirations failed after years of attempting to become the next Will Ferrell. He admitted to USA Today that his movie career “didn’t pan out” six years later. The comedian was subsequently informed that “SNL” executive producer Lorne Michaels had asked him if he wanted to replace Conan O’Brien on “Late Night.” And in 2009, following some wrangling with NBC, Fallon, and Michaels, the former actor finally accepted the role of host of a late-night talk show.</p><h3>Jimmy Fallon keeps his SNL roots close to him</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/jimmy-fallon-keeps-his-snl-roots-close-to-him-1671823693.jpg alt="jimmy fallon snl audition,jimmy fallon young,jimmy fallon snl skits,jimmy fallon snl characters,jimmy fallon snl 1998,jimmy fallon wife,jimmy fallon snl years,jimmy fallon snl christmas song,jimmy fallon snl it guy,jimmy fallon snl christmas opening,jimmy fallon snl host,jimmy fallon snl cast,jimmy fallon snl christmas monologue,justin timberlake and jimmy fallon snl,best of jimmy fallon snl,will ferrell jimmy fallon snl,best jimmy fallon snl skits,justin timberlake jimmy fallon snl family feud,harry styles jimmy fallon snl,jerry seinfeld jimmy fallon snl,debbie downer jimmy fallon snl" width=546 height=307 sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Read More: https://www.nickiswift.com/1148498/heres-why-jimmy-fallon-really-left-snl/Jimmy Fallon has become well-known for his extroverted demeanor and his entertaining games ever since he began hosting “Late Night” and later his own late-night talk show. Fallon remembered the exact moment he realized “That’s My Jam,” his spin-off game show, was going to be a big success. On Billboard’s “Pop Shop” podcast, he described the audience’s response to Ariana Grande and Kelly Clarkson’s performance as “people were weeping in the audience.” “Oh, man, this is cool, I think. This is fantastic television. It was spectacular.”</p><p>Since leaving “SNL,” Fallon has also offered counsel to the cast members who are still on the show. Current Weekend Update co-anchor Colin Jost described how he emailed Fallon for assistance during an appearance on “The Tonight Show,” when the talk show host co-anchored the news section with Tina Fey. One of the pieces of advise was to avoid introducing oneself at the start of the program, Jost remarked, later adding that he actually did so for the fake news show.</p><p>Both former and present “SNL” cast members have been invited to appear on the late-night talk show host’s program. For instance, Fallon stayed true to his “SNL” roots when John Mulaney and Pete Davidson played a hilarious round of “True <a href=#>Confessions</a>.”</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt="jimmy fallon snl audition,jimmy fallon young,jimmy fallon snl skits,jimmy fallon snl characters,jimmy fallon snl 1998,jimmy fallon wife,jimmy fallon snl years,jimmy fallon snl christmas song,jimmy fallon snl it guy,jimmy fallon snl christmas opening,jimmy fallon snl host,jimmy fallon snl cast,jimmy fallon snl christmas monologue,justin timberlake and jimmy fallon snl,best of jimmy fallon snl,will ferrell jimmy fallon snl,best jimmy fallon snl skits,justin timberlake jimmy fallon snl family feud,harry styles jimmy fallon snl,jerry seinfeld jimmy fallon snl,debbie downer jimmy fallon snl" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
