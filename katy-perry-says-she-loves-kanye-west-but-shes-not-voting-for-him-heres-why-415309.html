It seems like Perry shared the same opinion as many people out there."><meta name=author content="Tandra Barner"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The reason is that the singer wants to see a ‘pro’ at the White House, the rapper being unfit to be the next POTUS as far as she is concerned.</p><p>It seems like <a href=#>Perry</a> shared the same opinion as many people out there.</p><p>Kanye may be a really talented lyricist and composer but, at the end of the day, he is not what America needs in the Oval Office!</p><p>During a virtual interview for Hits Radio, Katy revealed that she does not take Ye seriously as a candidate, no matter how much she admires his artistry.</p><p>‘What we’ve learned looking back is that the presidential job is best suited for someone with experience and that is a pro in their field. I think we have seen and learned from experience that when we don’t have pros in position, that it can get a little wild. I love Kanye, he is amazing. I just, you know, I love him as an artist. And I think he’s an incredible disruptor as an artist and a conversation-maker as an artist. And that’s what I love the most about him,’ she dished.</p><p>Her opinion comes after days of Kanye teasing his presidential bid as well as his stances which have only caused a lot of controversy in the media.</p><p>It all started with him tweeting on the Fourth of July that ‘We must realize the promise of America by trusting God, by unifying our vision and building our future. I’m running for president of the United States! #2020VISION.’</p><p>Then, during a 4 hours long interview with Forbes magazine, the rapper rambled about being <a href=#>‘pro-life’</a> as well as an ‘anti-vaxxer,’ stances that obviously made a lot of people mad.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The religious rapper stated among many other things that ‘I am pro-life because I’m following the word of the bible. Planned Parenthoods have been placed inside cities by white supremacists to do the Devil’s work.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeblsG6ec%2BeqauxXaiuur%2BMrJ%2BeZZykw6a%2FjKSYp7GVYsSmv9Nmma6sXai1pr%2BMp6atZaakwaq6xmadqKpdnbaueceeqZ6rXay1unmTamxsaGlk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katherine-young-obituary-rhode-island.html><span>←</span><span>Katherine Young obituary Rhode Island</span></a>
