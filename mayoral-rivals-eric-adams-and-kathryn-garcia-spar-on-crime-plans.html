She couldn’t get trash off the street, why would anyone think she can get guns off the street?”</p><p>And Joseph Giacalone, a former NYPD sergeant and current John Jay College professor, said Garcia’s criticism rang hollow.</p><p>“Him [Adams] being a cop has nothing to do with anything. He’s no longer a cop, he’s a politician. She’s just trying to capitalize on the anti-cop movement. If all else fails lurch further left,” Giacalone, who’s not supporting any of the candidates, told The Post.</p><p>Officials with the Police Benevolent Association blasted Garcia’s gun violence platform.</p><p>“Why should we double down on failed ‘solutions’ to gun violence? If there’s one thing researchers and law enforcement experts agree on, it’s that GUN BUYBACKS DON’T WORK…” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the union tweeted</a>.</p><p>Additional reporting by Craig McCarthy and Sam Raskin.</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnnZbGsL7ApWSroaaWubR5xKugnGWRma6uv4yapZ1lm5bBqb7Yp2SgmaKYtqJ50qmYq2Wfo3qkvsimnGaonJa7tHuemqSp</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./author.html><span>←</span><span>Marshmello Face Reveal Has Caused An Uproar On Twitter</span></a>
