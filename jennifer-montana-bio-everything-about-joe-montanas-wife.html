Jennifer is an American model, actress, philanthropist, and entrepreneur from Eagle Pass, Pennsylvania.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You most likely know Jennifer Montana but not Jennifer Wallace. This is because the model was a nobody like every other non-celebrity before her marriage to the famous American footballer Joe Montana. Aside from being a model, Jennifer is an actress, philanthropist, and entrepreneur. Although she has a successful career, she is better known as the wife of the legendary San Francisco 49ers quarterback.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Jennifer Montana’s Biography</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name</strong>: Jennifer Montana</li><li><strong>Birth Name</strong>: Jennifer Sharon Wallace</li><li><strong>Nickname</strong>: Jen</li><li><strong>Gender</strong>: Female</li><li><strong>Date of Birth</strong>: 7th July 1958</li><li><strong>Place of Birth</strong>: New Eagle, Pennsylvania, USA</li><li><strong>Jennifer Montana’s Age</strong>: 65 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity</strong>: White</li><li><strong>Nationality</strong>: American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign</strong>: Cancer</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation</strong>: Straight</li><li><strong>Religion</strong>: Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status</strong>: Married</li><li><strong>Jennifer Montana’s Husband</strong>: Joe Montana</li><li><strong>Jennifer Montana’s Children</strong>: Alexandra Whitney Montana (daughter), Elizabeth Jean Montana (Daughter), Nathaniel Joseph Montana (son), Nicholas Alexander Montana (son)</li><li><strong>Jennifer Montana’s Height in Inches</strong>: 5 feet and 10 inches</li><li><strong>Jennifer Montana’s Height in Centimeters</strong>: 178 cm</li><li><strong>Jennifer Montana’s Weight</strong>: 65 kg</li><li><strong>Eye Color</strong>: Blue</li><li><strong>Hair Color</strong>: Blonde</li><li><strong>Occupation</strong>: Former Model, Actress, Entrepreneur</li><li><strong>Jennifer Montana’s Net Worth</strong>: $10 million</li><li><strong>Famous for</strong>: Being Joe Montana’s wife</li></ul><h2><strong>Jennifer Montana was Born in Pennsylvania 65 Years Ago</strong></h2><p>Jennifer Montana was born on the 7th of July, 1958, in New Eagle, Pennsylvania, USA, as Jennifer Sharon Wallace and she is 65 years old as of 2023. However, there are no available details about the type of family she was born into – who her parents or siblings are (if she has any). Also, there is no telling what growing up was like for her as she has kept her early life away from the media.</p><h2><strong>She Met Joe Montanna at a Schick Razor Commercial Shoot</strong></h2><p>In the 1980s, Jennifer Montana (then Jennifer Wallace) was contacted for a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Schick razor commercial</a>, and Joe was contacted for the same commercial. Aside from being excited that she would be working with someone taller than her (a not-so-common experience for her because of her tall height), Jennifer had a strictly professional mindset when she started working with Joe.</p><p>At the time of their meeting, Joe was already an established footballer, playing in the National Football League as a quarterback. However, the model knew nothing of this information, not until they started working together.</p><p>With time, they grew fonder of each other’s company, and the football star asked Jennifer out on a dinner date. When he got the check, Joe wrote on it, asking Jennifer what her reaction would be if he asked her to spend the rest of her life with him. This was just six months into their relationship, and Jennifer was not sure she wanted to get married at that time.</p><p>She neither gave him a “Yes” nor a “No”. Since he did not get a no, Joe believed he still had a chance, and of course, he did. The player gave Jennifer Montana some time and shot again. Still on a dinner date, but he had a plane to carry the message this time. The actress said “Yes,” and the rest is history.</p><h2><strong>Jennifer Became Joe Montana’s Third Wife In 1985</strong></h2><p>In 1985, the couple got married and have stayed married since then. For Jennifer, this was her first marriage, and she did not have any legal partner before Joe. On the other hand, it was Joe’s third marriage. Before his marriage to the actress, the player had been married to two women in the past. His first marriage was to Kim Moses in 1974. He was only 18 years old at the time, and the marriage ended three years later in 1977. In 1981, he got married to Cass Castillo. His second marriage also lasted for three years. He and Castillo went their separate ways in 1984.</p><p>A year later, he got married to Jennifer, his third and current wife. The couple has been together for about 38 years now.</p><h2><strong>Jennifer Montana and Her Husband Are Blessed With Four Kids</strong></h2><p>Joe did not have any children with his first two wives. Hence, all his children were birthed by Jennifer. Likewise, Jennifer didn’t have any other child outside her marriage. The couple has four kids; two girls and two boys.</p><h3><strong>Alexandra Montana</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name</strong>: Alexandra Whitney Montana</li><li><strong>Gender</strong>: Female</li><li><strong>Date of Birth</strong>: 10th October 1985</li><li><strong>Alexandra Montana’s Age</strong>: 38 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity</strong>: White</li><li><strong>Nationality</strong>: American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign</strong>: Scorpio</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation</strong>: Straight</li><li><strong>Religion</strong>: Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status</strong>: Single</li><li><strong>Education</strong>: Loyola Marymount University</li><li><strong>Occupation</strong>: Lawyer</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Alexandra-Montana-1024x747.jpg><p>Alexandra Montana is the first child of the couple. She was born the same year they got married. For her education, she attended the University of Notre Dame in the year 2004 to study law and by 2008, she earned her B.B. before proceeding to Loyola Law School in Loyola Marymount University where she earned her Masters of Law and Doctor of Law.</p><p>It is believed that Alexandra is currently practicing law though she has not revealed this herself as she prefers to keep a low profile away from the media. On the other hand, it is also not known if she is married or has kids.</p><h3><strong>Elizabeth Montana</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name</strong>: Elizabeth Jean Montana</li><li><strong>Gender</strong>: Female</li><li><strong>Date of Birth</strong>: 20th December 1986</li><li><strong>Elizabeth Montana’s Age</strong>: 37 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity</strong>: White</li><li><strong>Nationality</strong>: American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign</strong>: Sagittarius</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation</strong>: Straight</li><li><strong>Religion</strong>: Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status</strong>: Single</li><li><strong>Education</strong>: University of Notre Dame</li><li><strong>Elizabeth Montana’s Height in Inches</strong>: 67 inches</li><li><strong>Elizabeth Montana’s Height in Centimeters</strong>: 170 cm</li><li><strong>Elizabeth Montana’s Weight</strong>: 55 kg</li><li><strong>Body Measurements in Inches</strong>: 34-26-40</li><li><strong>Body Measurements in Centimeters</strong>: 86-66-102</li><li><strong>Occupation</strong>: Model</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/1200x0-1024x681.jpg><p>Elizabeth Montana was born on the 20th of December, 1986, one year after her parent’s marriage. She took after her mother as a model. Just like her elder sister, there aren’t many details about her professional and personal life as just a bit of information here and there exists about her. However, it is believed she is doing just fine staying off the radar.</p><h3><strong>Nathaniel Montana</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name</strong>: Nathaniel Joseph Montana</li><li><strong>Nickname</strong>: Nate</li><li><strong>Gender</strong>: Male</li><li><strong>Date of Birth</strong>: 3rd October 1989</li><li><strong>Nathaniel Montana’s Age</strong>: 32 yrs old</li><li><strong>Place of Birth</strong>: Santa Clara</li><li><strong>Ethnicity</strong>: White</li><li><strong>Nationality</strong>: American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign</strong>: Libra</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation</strong>: Straight</li><li><strong>Religion</strong>: Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status</strong>: Single</li><li><strong>Education</strong>: University of Notre Dame</li><li><strong>Nathaniel Montana’s Height in Inches</strong>: 76 Inches</li><li><strong>Nathaniel Montana’s Height in Centimeters</strong>: 193 cm</li><li><strong>Occupation</strong>: Football Player</li><li><strong>Nathaniel Montana’s Net Worth</strong>: $1.5 million</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/montananatejpg-1024x859.jpg><p>Joe and Jennifer had their first son, Nathaniel Montana, three years after they had Elizabeth. Nathaniel took after his father by becoming a football player and beyond the fame the family name gave him, the young man tried relentlessly to build up a legacy for himself but perhaps wasn’t good enough.</p><p>Jennifer Montana’s 6 feet 4 inches tall son and former quarterback started off his football career in high school with De La Salle High School in Concord, California. In college, he played for the University of Notre Dame’s Fighting Irish football team but later withdrew in 2009 to try Mt. SAC’s football program before returning to Notre Dame in January 2010. He later joined the University of Montana in February 2011 before finishing off at West Virginia Wesleyan, an NCAA Division II program.</p><p>Sadly, he went undrafted in the 2013 NFL draft and since then, not much has been reported about his football career and personal life though it is widely known he has a history of substance usage from his days in college.</p><h3><strong>Nicholas Montana</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name</strong>: Nicholas Alexander Montana</li><li><strong>Nickname</strong>: Nick</li><li><strong>Gender</strong>: Male</li><li><strong>Date of Birth</strong>: 28th April 1992</li><li><strong>Nicholas Montana’s Age</strong>: 31 years old</li><li><strong>Place of Birth</strong>: San Francisco</li><li><strong>Ethnicity</strong>: White</li><li><strong>Nationality</strong>: American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign</strong>: Taurus</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientatio</strong>n: Straight</li><li><strong>Religion</strong>: Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status</strong>: Single</li><li><strong>Education</strong>: University of Washington, Mt.

Like his elder brother, Nick also followed his father’s career path in football. He began honing his football career to become a professional athlete at the University of Washington but didn’t finish off there as he later transferred to Mt. San Antonio College, followed by Tulane University.</p><p>Though Nick had what appeared to be a promising career to fit in his father’s shoes, he went undrafted in the 2015 NFL draft, and that somewhat marked the end of his footballing career as a player.</p><h2><strong>What is Jennifer Montana Doing Now?</strong></h2><p>At the beginning of her career, Jennifer was a swimsuit model.
