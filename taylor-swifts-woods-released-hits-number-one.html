The song comes from her upcoming album, 1989, and the rumor is that this is the first song that the singer has released about her ex-boyfriend and fellow singer, Harry Styles of the band One Direction. He’s been waiting for a year to hear a song about him, and the lyrics tell us that it might just be time for him to stop the wait.</p><p>“It would be hypocritical for me to say she couldn’t do it because everybody writes songs based on personal experience,” said the boy-bander in an interview he did over the summer. So what makes people think that this is the song about the One Direction singer and the last guy that Swift has dated? Taylor Swift relationship experts (or fans, whatever you want to call them) have decoded three very important pieces of information in the song that give them the idea that this is the song about Styles.</p><p>In the song, Swift references last December in a line that goes, “looking at it now, last December, we were built to fall apart,” and that’s a reference to the fact that the couple broke up for good in December. Another line in the song references a necklace that Styles wears frequently and that Swift was snapped wearing on occasion, “your necklace hanging from my neck.” And finally, in a line that goes, “remember when you hit the brakes too soon, twenty stitches in a hospital room,” and that references a snow mobile accident that the two were involved in when they were dating.</p><p>So, with that said, it’s apparent that this is the song about Styles that world has been waiting for. Happy listening, Taylor Swift fans.</p><p>Photo by Larry Busacca/Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina2rXay8sLDSZqmepJWWwKawjKGgratdo8KursSrZKimlWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./steve-harvey-fights-back-against-rumors-of-400m-divorce-from-marjorie-im-sick-of-it.html><span>←</span><span>Steve Harvey Fights Back AgainstRumors of $400M Divorce from Marjorie: Im Sick of It</span></a>
