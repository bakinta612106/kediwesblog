It's hard to consider Denver Broncos tight end Greg Dulcich a high-end draft sleeper.
Denver's tight end situation is cloudy—Adam Trautman and Lucas Krull could vie for targets this season—while hamstring and foot injuries limited Dulcich to two games in 2023."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

He is still recovering from foot surgery but could return to practice before the end of minicamp, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Mike Klis</a> of 9 News Denver.<br></p><p>Dulcich's injury history is concerning, as hamstring issues have been a problem since he was drafted. However, he could be an enticing sleeper by the end of training camp—if he's back to 100 percent and if Denver's QB competition between Zach Wilson, Jarrett Stidham and <a href=#>Bo Nix</a> yields a functional starter.<br></p><p><b>Noah Gray, Kansas City Chiefs, Ranked 45th</b><br></p><p>Kelce remains one of the NFL's most consistent tight ends, and the Kansas City Chiefs star is likely to again be drafted highly in 2024—he's currently ranked second at his position. However, he will turn 35 in October and is coming off his first sub-1,000-yard season since 2015.<br></p><p>Backup tight end Noah Gray is a must-target insurance policy for managers who use a first- or second-round selection on Kelce. The 25-year-old had 28 receptions, 305 yards and two touchdowns last season.<br></p><p><b>Josh Oliver, Minnesota Vikings, Ranked 54th</b><br></p><p>Minnesota Vikings tight end T.J. Hockenson was a Pro Bowler in 2023 and finished with 95 catches, 960 receiving yards and five touchdowns, but he's also coming off a serious knee injury that involved a torn ACL and MCL.<br></p><p>The 26-year-old is still ranked 13th among tight ends, but managers should understand that he isn't likely to play early in the season. According to The Athletic's <a href=# rel=noopener>Alec Lewis</a>, "the Vikings are committed to ensuring he is fully healthy before he plays."</p><p>Josh Oliver, who had 22 catches, 213 yards and two touchdowns last season, may have early-season value during his teammate's recovery. He's also a must-target handcuff for anyone looking to draft Hockenson early.<br></p><p><b>Tommy Tremble, Carolina Panthers, Ranked 64th</b><br></p><p>The Carolina Panthers didn't have many fantasy standouts in 2023, but that could change if quarterback Bryce Young makes a second-year jump. With Dave Canales in as head coach, that is entirely possible.<br></p><p>Canales helped turn both Geno Smith and Baker Mayfield into Pro Bowlers over the last two seasons. He also helped tight end Cade Otton (47 catches, 455 yards, 4 TDs) become a viable fantasy streamer in 2023.<br></p><p>It's worth keeping an eye on Carolina's Tommy Tremble, who led the team's tight end room with 23 catches, 194 yards and three touchdowns last season.</p><p>Rookie fourth-round pick <a href=#>Ja'Tavion Sanders</a> (29th) is ranked higher than Tremble, but the veteran has a big edge in experience and could become a serviceable streamer in Canales' offense this season.<br></p><p><i>*Consensus fantasy rankings and scoring information from <a href=# rel=noopener>FantasyPros</a>.</i><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYml%2Fd3%2BMn5inrJGoxm6yzqirm5mcoXpzfJFtZKyklZq9pr6MrZysZaSkerWt0aCcrWWRm8GmvoydmKuqlaN6uK3LpZyrZaKawaq%2BxKacp6w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./173996-fake-home-affairs-officer-busted-vryheid-viral-video-south-africans-disappointed-him.html><span>←</span><span>Fake Home Affairs Officer Busted in Vryheid in Viral Video, South Africans Disappointed in Him</span></a>
