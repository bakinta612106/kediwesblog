Hairstylist <strong>Shelby Swain</strong> and makeup artist <strong>Alexx Mayo</strong>. While vision boards, an on-the-go beauty store and many outfit changes are needed for the Instagram glam sessions, the shoots have actually been fairly spontaneous.</p><p class=p1>Back in February 2021, when Lizzo debuted an absolutely absurd yet totally amazing 9-foot long ponytail, Swain told Us Weekly: “In the pandemic, I have much more time to be creative and be free. Lizzo has always spoken to me about trying to step out and do more shoots to show off her hair. So finally I was like, ‘Hey, you wanna do a shoot at my house?’”</p><p class=p1>When Lizzo has a red carpet in the books though, Stylish has come to expect some seriously outrageous hair and makeup.

She completed the look with a flipped out ponytail, bling-encrusted nails and a smoky orange eye. Oh, and who could forget her micro-sized handbag?!</p><p class=p1>While Lizzo most definitely knows how to bring her best to glam, she’s also the first to embrace her natural beauty and show her 10.4 million Instagram followers her face and body sans filters or photoshop.</p><p class=p1>In April 2021 the “Juice” singer partnered with Dove to work towards “transforming social media into a more positive and empowering place for the next generation.”</p><p class=p1>Lizzo’s first step towards fostering realistic beauty standards?
