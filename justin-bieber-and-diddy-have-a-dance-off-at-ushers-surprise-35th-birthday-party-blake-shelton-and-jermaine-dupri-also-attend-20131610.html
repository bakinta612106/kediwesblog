Guests arrived at 10:30 p.m. and Usher came at 11,” a source told <strong>Us</strong>. “Bieber came with <strong>Scooter [Braun]</strong> and hung out with Usher in a booth. <a href=#>Usher’s girlfriend</a> Grace [Miguel] was there as well.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The S&M Cirque du Soleil themed party had girls “in plastic balls and with whips and chains.” Guests also enjoyed a cake made to look like a boxing ring. (Usher is set to play the retired professional boxer Leonard in the 2014 film Hands of Stone.) “Usher was clearly having the time of his life,” the insider added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>DJ Rashida</strong> entertained the guests, and eventually Diddy and the “Heartbreaker” singer took it to the dance floor at 1 a.m. to “All I Want For My Birthday” by <strong>2 Chainz</strong> — including the birthday boy! “All the guys were dancing and there was sort of a dance-off between Usher, his one-time protege Bieber, Diddy and the others,” the eyewitness said. “The crowd was going nuts.” The “Boyfriend” singer clearly had a good time too. After the party, <a href=#>he tweeted:</a> @Usher that was a great time. love u man. happy birthday.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGuq6Seu26uyJ6ZnqpdlrulecOim52xXZ2ut7GMmmSdmZ6Ysm67xZ9kmqxdqsCpsdGsZKytoqW%2Fqr%2FEZmpurJhir6q%2B06GbmrFdpa6zwNhmmaWZm5p6tLTEpauopl2Wu6V5yZ6pppmZo7JusNSpqaJlkaHAsHnAraueppRif3F9kmptamg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jugraj-sandhu.html><span>←</span><span>Jugraj Sandhu- Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Ethnicity, Net Worth, Girlfriend</span></a>
