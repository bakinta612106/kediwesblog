The mogul's latest acquisition, indie-folk duo Wardell, is comprised of <strong>Theo</strong> and <strong>Sasha</strong> <strong>Spielberg</strong>, two of Oscar-winning filmmaker <strong>Steven Spielberg</strong>'s and <strong>Kate Capshaw</strong>'s children.</p><p>Big brother Theo, 25, provides all the instrumentals for Wardell (including guitar, drums, and piano) and sister Sasha, 23, the nostalgia-tinged vocals. Roc Nation's website describes their collaboration thusly: "Sasha and Theo are brother and sister. That familiarity and fondness informs the music that they make together, which is at once warm and summery, comfortable and chill as a result of their Los Angeles upbringing." The management company also represents <a href=#>Shakira</a>, <strong>Haim</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Rihanna</strong></a> and <strong>Kylie Minogue</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=#>Teen Vogue</a> this year, the musical pair talked about what inspired them to pursue music (Theo cites <strong>The Strokes</strong>' This Is It, while Sasha points to <a href=#><strong>Christina Aguilera</strong></a>'s Stripped and <strong>Janis Joplin</strong>'s Pearl) and what it's like to work together. "It's pretty rad," said Sasha. "The amount of inside jokes between us has skyrocketed…"</p><p>It's been quite a year for the talented siblings, who played with <strong>Vampire Weekend</strong> and <strong>Haim</strong> at the storied South by Southwest music festival in Austin in March and released their debut EP, Brother/Sister, this summer. In addition to being signed by a major label, Sasha, according to The Hollywood Reporter, recently sold the pilot Girls Without Boys (co-written with <strong>Emily Goldwyn</strong> and produced by <strong>Rashida Jones</strong>) to ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOrKuerpWjerS8yJ6jm52inMBut8idqmaakaOxbsPAq5uepJxiwKqzzZ6bZpqpYreixYyzqmaqn5h6r63ToqanZWJlfnSEkGk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./steps-to-dating-a-female.html><span>←</span><span>Steps to Dating a female Celebsgraphy</span></a>
