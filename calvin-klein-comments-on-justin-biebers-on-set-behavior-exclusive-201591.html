<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Calvin Klein Comments on Justin Bieber's On-Set Behavior: Exclusive</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Don't believe the hype! &nbsp;</p><p>A representative for Calvin Klein recently opened up exclusively to <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong>&nbsp;before rumors spread that <strong><a href=#>Justin Bieber</a> </strong>was difficult to work with on the set of his history-making #MyCalvins fashion campaign. The images of the pop superstar, showing off his abs and fit body with Dutch fashion model <strong>Lara Stone</strong>, were released exclusively to <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> on Tuesday, Jan. 6.</p>&nbsp;<p>"We shot the print and video campaigns over several days at Silvercup Studios with photographers Mert & Marcus and Johan Renck, who directed the campaign video," Melisa Goldie, Chief Marketing Officer at Calvin Klein told&nbsp;<strong>Us</strong>. "Justin showed up early every day with amazing energy; he completely trusted us and gave it his all."&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p>&nbsp;<p>Goldie also notes that although Bieber is a novice in modeling, he took direction well. "Lara [Stone] definitely gave Justin some modeling pointers, especially when we shot the print images, but when we started to shoot the commercial, Justin had some pointers for Lara," the brand said. "He came alive when it was time to perform, especially when the drum kit came out — it was really impressive."&nbsp;</p><p>In between takes and grueling workout stints with his trainer, Bieber hung out and played ping-pong with the crew. "Justin loves to play and when they were breaks during the shoot, a game would ensue, and there was some heavy competition," Goldie revealed.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall Calvin Klein stands behind their choice of Bieber for the campaign. "We are incredibly proud of the final images and how they portray Justin and Lara," Goldie said. "This campaign will definitely make history."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmqq2xnJp8r7HWrGacmZyrtq95yqWcoqZdmLyuucSnq6xln6N6q8HSraCnZZKesqOx0axkqKZdqLK1ecGen5qumaS%2FbrHXnKOuq5mrsm55kWlobnFh</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./big-meech-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Big Meech Wife, Son, Sister, Net Worth, Brother, Dad</span></a>
