This role marks Mason’s debut as a lead actor on screen.</strong></p><p>Ginny and Georgia is a Netflix dark comedy about a mother, Georgia, who goes to great lengths to protect her two children, including a daughter named Ginny. Ginny & Georgia features an ensemble cast, and Mason Temple portrays Hunter, one of Ginny’s love interests. He was a major character in the first two seasons of the show, and this has piqued the interest of fans about the identity of this Hollywood “newcomer”.</p><h2><strong>Who Plays Hunter in Ginny and Georgia?</strong></h2><p>Mason Temple plays Hunter in Ginny and Georgia. Mason is of Canadian and Taiwanese origin and grew up in Fort St John, British Columbia, Canada. He began modeling as a child and during his school days, got hooked on theatrical productions.</p><p>He appeared in several and went on to join hands with his peers to found a theater group called Spectacular Chair Factory. The group performed at various local festivals, and Temple fell deeper in love with acting. He thereafter decided to head out to college upon graduating high school in 20014. He enrolled in the theater program at Langara College and completed it in a few years.</p><p>Mason Temple kicked off his professional career with a string of guest appearances in TV shows as well as theatrical productions. He later got his big break after he was cast in the role of Hunter in Ginny and Georgia. His character is a teenage boy who is involved in a love triangle with Ginny and Marcus. At the end of the day, he and Ginny split up permanently.</p><h2><strong>What is Mason Temple’s Age?</strong></h2><p>Mason Temple is 27&nbsp;years old. The Ginny and Georgia actor was born on the 17th of January 1996 in Canada. Mason’s age means that he is quite older than the character that he portrays in Ginny and Georgia.</p><p>Hunter Chen is a 15/16-year-old high schooler. As of February 2021, when Ginny and Georgia was released, Mason Temple was already 25 years old and thus about ten years older than the character he portrays. He was, however, able to apply his acting skills so expertly that he captured all the essence, anguish, and experiences of a high schooler expertly.</p><p>Mason Temple is not the only adult that is portraying a teen in Ginny and Georgia. Others like Antonia Gentry (Ginny) and Felix Mallard (Marcus) are also several years older than the characters they portray. They, however, all render awesome performances, which made the show one of the most watched on Netflix.</p><h2><strong>What is Mason Temple’s Ethnicity?</strong></h2><p>Mason Temple is half-Caucasian and half-Asian. He gets his Asian heritage from his father, who is from Taiwan, and his Caucasian heritage from his Canadian mother. Mason Temple is quite proud of his Asian roots and has even gone ahead to obtain a Taiwanese passport, meaning that he now has dual Canadian and Taiwanese nationalities.</p><p>Mason Temple is also quite attuned to the fact that he is not just Asian but biracial. He has therefore spoken about the particular experiences of biracial people. He has also worked it into some of the theatrical productions that he has written.</p><p>According to Temple, biracial people often find themselves cast out from the two ethnic groups they come from, which affects them. The actor has also revealed that Hollywood often casts biracial people as mono-racial, but he turns down those roles when offered as he wants to accurately represent his heritage.</p><h2><strong>Where is Mason Temple From?</strong></h2><p>Mason Temple is from Fort St John, one of the largest cities in British Columbia province, Canada. Fort St John is known as an energetic city because of its diversified resource base, such as agriculture, natural gas, oil, etc.</p><p>Mason Temple spent the first 18 years of his life in <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Fort St John</a>, where he attended schools such as North Peace Secondary School. He participated in school productions as well as local theatrical scenes.</p><p>Seeing his potential, many people advised Mason Temple to leave Fort St John after graduating high school to seek better opportunities. He did so in 2014 and headed out to Vancouver, where he continued pursuing his career and training.</p><h2><strong>How Tall is Mason Temple?</strong></h2><p>Mason Temple is 5 feet 9 inches tall or 175 cm tall. This puts him at the same height as the average American man out there (5 feet 9 inches) and just half an inch shorter than the average leading man in Hollywood (5 feet 9.5 inches).</p><p>Mason Temple’s height is surely not a handicap in his showbiz career. It helped him land modeling gigs in the early days of his journey. It would also come in handy when he is cast in teen heartthrob roles, such as the one in Ginny and Georgia.</p><h2><strong>Is Hunter on Ginny and Georgia Season 2</strong></h2><p>Hunter is in Ginny and Georgia season 2 and appears in about 9 episodes. Hunter attends the same high school as Ginny and is a budding musician. He really fancies Ginny, and they start talking and eventually formalize their relationship. However, the lingering feelings that Ginny has towards Marcus, another school mate always looms large above her and Hunter.</p><p>In Season 1, Episode 10, Hunter discovers that Ginny cheated on him with Marcus. This leads him to punch Marcus in the face and marks the end of his relationship with Ginny. Following this unraveling, Hunter’s role is diminished in Season 2 of Ginny and Georgia, but he still appeared in several episodes.</p><p>One of them is episode four at a birthday party thrown for Marcus and his twin sister named Max. At the party, Hunter and Ginny get a chance to talk about their split and find some closure.</p><h2><strong>What Movies is Mason Temple In?</strong></h2><p>Mason Temple is set to appear in the upcoming movie Boot Camp, which was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia. Boot Camp is a rom-com about a nonathletic lady, Whitney Carmichael, who decides to reinvent herself by participating in an intense summer boot camp. During the camp, she finds herself falling for her trainer, Axel.</p><p>Boot Camp features drew Ray Tanner and Rachel Boudwin in the lead roles, while Mason Temple plays the role of Jonah, who crosses paths with Whitney at some point.<br>Asides from Boot Camp, all of Mason Temple’s other acting credits come on the small screens. They are iZombie (2018), Six (2018), V.C. Andrews’ Landry Family (2021), and Ginny and Georgia (2021).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaqaG2r7HRZ5qopV%2BstbB5yKxkoa2eqbKzecWrpqZll567r8WMmqWdZZeavLOzyJpkpp2VqXqurdKopWaslaK9rbGO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-cass-elliots-daughter.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened To Cass Elliot's Daughter?</span></a>
