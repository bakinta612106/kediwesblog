Don’t their germs come downstream to the next person? Looks fun, but I’m cool on that.’</p><p>Another follower noticed the same thing and said: ‘So everyone was catching noodles from the same water with the chopsticks that just came out their mouth? Y’all gonna have mono.’</p><p>One fan posted, ‘Seems kind of gross to me 😂 but maybe it’s really hot water that kills the germs.’</p><p>And eventually, someone else felt the same and said: ‘I’m certain I’d have THE FIRST SEAT because if I see somebody germs touch my food IMMA STARVE!!!!😩😩GOD, bless Your germaphobic children, in Jesus’ name.😩😩’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Would you eat at such a restaurant?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeblrultYybrKuqpajAbq3NnWSroZyaxm6u1KuprqujYsCxrdGkZJplmK60qrHNnmSrnZyWwaawjJ2cm5mkmnq4tdOhZK2glWK5osDErKtmqJmYwG6y0aikZqOppMGweZFxcHBqZGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joey-king.html><span>←</span><span>Joey King: Age, height, husband, parents, net worth</span></a>
