In 2009, he released his “I Hate College (Remix)” via YouTube. A remix of Asher Roth’s “I Love College,” Adams’ remix went viral, collecting 13 million views. He followed by sharing the stage with Drake, Kid Cudi, Big Sean, Wiz Khalifa, Snoop Dogg, Mike Posner, Curren$y, and Tiesto.</p><p>In 2010, Adams dropped his first EP, Boston’s Boy, which debuted at number one on iTunes’ hip-hop chart. “Driving Me Crazy,” which sampled Annie Lennox’s hit, “Walking On Broken Glass,” hit #8 on iTunes’ hip-hop singles chart.</p><p>Without a major label, Boston’s Boy took the 73rd slot on The Billboard 200.</p><p>https://soundcloud.com/samadamslive/dna-2/s-GwFWT3gu6Yn</p><p>Since 2015, Adams has amassed more than 200 million streams on Spotify, with hits like “All Night Longer,” “Tellin’ Me,” and “Where You Are (feat. Wyred).” In 2018, Adams survived a life-threatening accident that left him with a broken neck and two brain hemorrhages, putting his music career on hold. Beating the odds that he would ever walk or perform again, he miraculously recovered, regaining full range of motion.</p><p>Following his injury and parting ways with a major label, Adams is back with a body of work which is his first independent project in over a decade.</p><p>“DNA” opens on emerging, kaleidoscopic tones rolling into a tight, syncopated rhythm with crisp percussion. Shaded by dark resonance, the tune oozes residual energy as Adams’ evocative flow imbues the rhymes with haunting timbres dripping with subtle sonic nuances.</p><p>Sammy Adams has it going on! With “DNA,” he puts his gift for stylish rhythm, captivating flow, and fluent rhymes on full display.</p><p>Follow Sammy Adams <a href=#>Instagram</a> | <a href=#>Twitter</a> | <a href=#>Facebook</a> | <a href=#>Spotify</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Tour-663x1024.webp><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kura%2FyJxkqaqVoramvsRmqpqlna56orDApqpmnKKkvbR5zZ6uZquZo7StsYydpZpn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miley-cyrus-jokes-that-she-and-selena-are-pregnant-with-bieber-babies-2015164.html><span>←</span><span>Miley Cyrus Jokes That She and Selena Are Pregnant With Bieber Babies</span></a>
