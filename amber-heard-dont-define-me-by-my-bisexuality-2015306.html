<span>Patria Henriques</span></p><h1>Amber Heard: Don't Define Me By My Bisexuality</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Amber Heard</strong> is taking over Hollywood on her own terms. As one of the few female actresses in Magic Mike XXL, Heard is relishing in the fact that the sequel potrays women in a power position. "It's a film about men seeking sexual attention,” Heard, 29, told The Times of the stripper flick fronted by <a href=#><strong>Channing Tatum</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Joe Manganiello</strong></a>, and <a href=#><strong>Matt Bomer</strong></a>. "My character’s function has nothing to do with her sexuality.”</p><p>Heard, who dated photographer <strong>Tasya van Ree</strong> before marrying<a href=#> <strong>Johnny Depp</strong></a>, 52, in February, is enriched by roles that allow her to flex her acting chops instead of being pigeonholed because of her gender or sexuality. "I don't want to have to deny my sexuality in order to be me. But I don't want to have to be defined by it," the bisexual actress told The Times (via UK's Independent). "I'm fundamentally opposed to trying to edit myself to be palatable or popular. I don't give a f–k. I fight, but I shouldn't have to."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Though Heard seldom talks about her private life with Depp, she has said in the past that she's maintained her independence, both personally and professionally, since becoming a Mrs.</p><p>"I have a fiercely independent spirit," the actress told Elle. "The thing that really scares me is the potential of losing my freedom. I never want for my life to lose the ability to transverse the world, with freedom and ease. The freedom and ease I have worked so hard to acquire for myself."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJimmpWneqmxwKubZpyfo8FusMSfoKedXaKybq7YZqSyZZKewKbE1JqjoqypYn9xfZRsZ28%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alexa-davalos-phone-number.html><span>←</span><span>Alexa Davalos Phone Number, WhatsApp Number, House Address, Email Id</span></a>
