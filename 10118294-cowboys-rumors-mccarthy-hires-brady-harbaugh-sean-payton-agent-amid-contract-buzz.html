Yee is one of the most prominent agents in the NFL, representing Jim Harbaugh, Sean Payton and Tom Brady.</p><p>McCarthy is 42-25 in his four seasons with the Cowboys, making the playoffs in each of the last three years. Unfortunately, that's where McCarthy's success has stopped. Dallas is 1-3 under McCarthy in the playoffs, including an embarrassing 48-32 loss to the Green Bay Packers in the 2024 Wild Card Round.</p><p>That loss put McCarthy firmly on the hot seat, though owner Jerry Jones did decide to retain him for next season. The 60-year-old coach will head into the 2024 season without long-term security, and Jones has offered McCarthy no long-term assurances.</p><p>McCarthy has kept a positive attitude publicly about the situation, saying he's focused on improving the Cowboys coming into 2024.</p><p>"I think you can't lose sight of the big picture," McCarthy <a href=# rel=noopener>told reporters</a> last month. "I know this has always been my approach. Make no bones about it, I am extremely blessed to be here. I'm very much engaged where my feet are and the opportunities I've had personally, I'm very blessed. I never lose sight of that. That's always been my big picture approach."</p><p>"Now, when I look at the younger coaches, yeah, I worry more about them more than I do myself because I know where I am in my career. But the reality of it is if you don't take the same approach every year, you're really looking at it the wrong way."</p><p>McCarthy isn't the only prominent Cowboy heading into next season without long-term security. Quarterback Dak Prescott and wide receiver CeeDee Lamb both have contracts that expire after the 2024 campaign. While it's likely both players will wind up receiving new deals to stay in Dallas, it's clear Jones is keeping all of his most prominent names on their toes.</p><p>McCarthy previously spent 13 years coaching the Green Bay Packers, winning one Super Bowl but continually falling just short in his eight other playoff appearances. He's 11-11 overall in the playoffs as a head coach.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYW1%2FeoCMnKawmp%2BuwG6%2B1Kamq6tdorCkrdGtn7JlmJ6%2Fpr%2BMm6manKlitaK%2BwZqsoKBdqLKiuoypmLKsn6N6orPEp6tmmZ2esW6vzqerq5mTqXqjwdmz</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-browns-baby-mama-ammika-harris-shows-off-her-flawless-calves-see-her-black-swan-look-476482.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Browns Baby Mama, Ammika Harris Shows Off Her Flawless Calves See Her Black Swan Loo</span></a>
