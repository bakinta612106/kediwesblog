Ray-J, whose father is a vocal coach, took to the internet to recommit to his vocal training publicly and join in on the jokes about himself.</span></p><h3>Ray’s Road To “Ray-demption”</h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In one of his more recent Instagram posts, Ray joined his father Willie Norwood at the piano for some proper training.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“First Vocal lesson with my dad!&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>@vocalcoachnorwood</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>after taking the L at&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>@verzuztv</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;– my son Epik doesn’t want me to train – he feels I’m better at reality TV and Marketing but I’ll show him!

I was supposed to drink tea and I was only supposed to stay in one place for the whole performance” said Ray on where he went wrong.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ray then admitted that he tried to delete Brandy’s public comment calling him out and he offered her an apology.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“I tried to delete that…I love my sister because it’s so important to make sure you perfect your craft as much as you can and give the world a good show. I mean, I entertained though, but as far as the vocals, I have a lot of redeeming to do.” Ray continued, “She’s hard on me on this, so it’s not redemption, it’s Ray-demption. I apologized to my sister right on the spot…right after I hit the note I apologized.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Talk host Natalie Morales then asked, “You haven’t talked to Brandy since?” to which Ray J responded;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“B, I’m sorry. I know you know that I’m good at singing and I promise you, I’m not gonna let you down, okay.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>His singing may need some help, but Ray-J needs no advice on courting attention, staying relevant, and most importantly securing a bag. Since the show, Ray is reportedly working on forming a group with his Verzuz teammates/opponents, Sammie, Bobby V, and Pleasure P called <strong>RSVP</strong>.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>If Ray-J’s “One Wish” to get his vocals back comes true, will you be checking for new music from RSVP?</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOq5iyZZpirrG7y6ieorKVqHq1u4ybqZqmlK56p7vRZquhp6Oaere10ZqjZq6Vp8e2xoyvppyZnKh8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./neither-democrat-nor-republican-abbr-html.html><span>←</span><span>Neither Democrat nor Republican: Abbr.</span></a>
