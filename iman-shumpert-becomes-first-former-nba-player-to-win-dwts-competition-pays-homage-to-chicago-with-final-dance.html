In the Monday night episode, Shumpert paid homage to Chicago by incorporating some of the footwork called juking into their performance. It was down to Shumpert and dancer-singer JoJo Siwa when Tyra Banks announced with a happy and shocking reaction that Shumpert was the winner.</p><p>Last night, Shumpert received an overwhelming amount of love and congratulations from friends and fans, but no one was more excited than his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wife</a>, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Teyana Taylor</a></strong>. The R&B singer, who is also a dancer herself, took to Instagram to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">share</a> several moments of her husband on the dance floor. In the final post, she filmed herself and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">their daughter</a>, Junie, screaming at the TV right after it was announced that he was the winner.</p><p>In the caption, she wrote, “THE LEVEL OF PROUD I AM IS TEWWWWWW MUCH TO EVEN PUT IN WORDS!!! WOW 🥺🥺🥺 congrats @imanshumpert @daniellakaragach i am proud but NOT shocked!!!! YALL GOT THAT! AS YOU SHOULD! WELL DESERVED!! Thank you for trusting one another, believing in one another, killing that shit every week & most importantly foot working that mutha fucking mirror ball home!!!!!! PERIOD! Congrats guys!!! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥”</p><p>Another important lady in Shumpert’s life who may be as equally as excited as his wife, is his mother, L’Tanya Shumpert. The 31-year-old revealed a few days ago that his mother is a huge fan of the show and said he would like to win the competition for her.</p><p>After winning last night, he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told</a> People that his parents have come to all of his performances every week, but weren’t able to make it during the finale because they were diagnosed with COVID-19. “When they said our name, I couldn’t think about nothing but what they were doing right now, how they were feeling about it [and] being able to watch it,” he said.</p><p>Shumpert added, “I just can’t wait for my mom to actually get our hands on this trophy because this is a show that means a lot to her.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>More Stories from Our Partners:</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘He Do It Without Glory’: Iman Shumpert Explains Why LeBron James Gets So Much Hate</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘The Offense Didn’t Get The Job Done, That Starts With Me’| Is Dak Prescott Earning His Money In Dallas?</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Remember Your Why’: Life and Career Coach Tana M.
