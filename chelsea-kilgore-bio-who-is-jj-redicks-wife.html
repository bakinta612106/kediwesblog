However, she is not the only child of her parents as she shared her mother’s womb with a twin sister, Kylie Jean.</p><p>To date, Chelsea shares a very beautiful relationship with her twin sister as can be seen on social media, where she shares enviable pictures of herself and her twin. JJ Redick refers to his wife and her twin sister as ‘besties’ and is fond of calling Kylie his ‘half wife’.</p><p>Considering the relationship they share as adults, it may be safe to say they had a good time growing up together as twin sisters.</p><h3><strong>Chelsea Kilgore Is A Graduate Of Mississippi State University</strong></h3><p>Chelsea and her twin sister attended Canton Public School.

At the time they met, JJ Redick was not as famous and rich as he is today. He was still on the journey to proving that he was good enough for the NBA.</p><p>The lovebirds started dating the same year they met, got engaged in July 2009, and on the 26th of June 2010, they tied the knot. It was like a script from the movies and perhaps, the beautiful part about it is that the couple has remained married ever since. Their wedding was attended by only close friends and family and while the location of the event is not known, they had their honeymoon in Spain and Italy.</p><h2><strong>Since They Got Married, They Have Moved To Different Cities, Depending On JJ Redick’s Career Demand</strong></h2><p>Being married to a basketball player goes beyond the fame and glamour that comes with being his wife, it requires some sacrifices as well.

In 2013, he moved to Milwaukee Bucks. Later in 2013, JJ moved to the Los Angeles Clippers and after playing for the team for almost four years, he moved to the Philadelphia 76ers in 2017. In 2019, he moved to the New Orleans Pelicans, and in 2021 to the Dallas Mavericks.</p><p>Before moving to the Los Angeles Clippers, they bought a house in Austin, Texas, but in 2016, they had to sell the house. Through all the movement, Chelsea Kilgore has been very supportive of her husband and his career.</p><h2><strong>Chelsea Kilgore Is A Mother Of Two</strong></h2><p>Chelse Kilgore is a proud mother of two amazing children both of whom are products of her marriage to JJ Redick. Her first son was born in August 2014 and is called Knox. His parents named him after the popular American indie-rock band ‘Knox Hamilton.’ Two years after the birth of the first, they welcomed their second child named Kai.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Chelsea-Kilgore-fam-1.jpg alt="Chelsea Kilgore" width=696 height=545 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Knox and Kai are still quite young and have not chosen a career path yet.

In 2011, when the foundation was launched, Chelsea Kilgore was very much involved in the management. As of today, the foundation has ceased to exist and the immediate cause of this was the fact that Chelsea and JJ had to leave Austin, Texas.</p><p>It is noteworthy to add that while married to JJ Redick and assisting with the management of his foundation, Chelsea Kilgore still worked as a Pilates instructor.</p><h3><strong>JJ Redick Is Very Open About Chelsea Kilgore’s Support For Him</strong></h3><p>In an interview, JJ Redick mentioned that since Chelse came into his life, it has taken a positive turn.

During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Redick tweeted about the many milestones in his children’s life he was missing while he was in the NBA bubble. He counts himself fortunate to have Chelsea who has constantly shown she is up for the challenge as she has oftentimes covered for him at the home front.</p><h3><strong>Chelsea Kilgore’s Husband Has Retired From Playing Basketball</strong></h3><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/jj-redick-1-1.jpg alt="Chelsea Kilgore" width=696 height=464 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>After 15 years of playing basketball for six different professional teams, JJ Redick announced his retirement in 2021 via his podcast The Old Man and The Three.
