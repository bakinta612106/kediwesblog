Long story short, Hudgens’ younger sister, <a href=#><strong>Stella Hudgens</strong></a>, is really good friends with Beer. The unlikely duo were really frustrated with the “trial and error” of finding an effective skincare routine, but are now here to help anyone who might be going through the same thing.</p><p>Hudgens posted on her <a href=#>Instagram</a> and <a href=#>Twitter</a> the exciting news.</p><p><a href=#>https://twitter.com/VanessaHudgens/status/1407388152906489856</a></p><p>Hudgens wrote on her Instagram, “I’ve been working away behind-the-scenes on a project for over a year now.&nbsp;Anyone that knows me knows, I’m a maximalist when it comes to skincare, but I always thought there should be an easier way to figure out what’s actually right for your skin. KNOW Beauty is a smarter way to build a skincare routine that takes the guesswork out of the process.”</p><p>The actress opened up about that she didn’t struggle with acne much of her life, but as soon as she turned 21, her skin started to become more sensitive to certain things.</p><p>“Growing up, I never really had a ton of acne. I kind of got by with a face wipe and everything was fine until I hit 21.&nbsp;All I wanted to do was drink wine and eat cheese. So naturally, my skin freaked out.&nbsp;My main things now, because I’m not in my twenties anymore, is perseverance of the skin—skin elasticity, collagen reproduction, and fine lines. Just kind of taking care of the skin that I have because it’s the only skin that I got,” she says.</p><p>The “Life Support” singer and former Disney&nbsp;actress have paired up with&nbsp;<strong>Dr. Karen Kagha&nbsp;</strong>to analyze your DNA, curate a skincare routine, and recommend the right products just for your skin. Customers will be able to purchase a $95 DNA Kit with a cheek swab for you to send back. Then, the skin genetics are analyzed, from your collagen renewal, pigmentation, sun damage, skin sensitivity, and antioxidant support. After the analyzation, the brand recommends a routine tailored to you. The products range from purifying face washes to lightweight lotions, which will cost from $20-$30.</p><p>“We combine all that information from each consumer and develop an algorithm to make a skin-care suggestion based on our curated skin-care products. We have about 17 products in total, but there are hundreds of different combinations. If you go through the process, we’ll recommend a routine — a cleanser, serum, day and night moisturizer, and face mask — all personalized based on the results of your tests that you can shop directly on our website,” Dr. Kaghan explains.</p><p>Beer also took to social media to share the exciting collaboration on her <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p>“After dealing with acne on & off for years i realized that i honestly have no idea what i was putting on my face, and it felt like everything made my acne worse. i always thought there should be an easier way to figure out the right products to use,” Beer shared.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/screen-shot-2021-06-22-at-2-39-53-pm-1624387206-681x1024.png><p>In an interview with <a href=#><strong>Harper’s BAZAAR</strong></a>, Beer opened up about her struggles with cystic acne, especially being in the spotlight and always having to be camera ready.</p><p>“There are times where I look at my Instagram and I’m like, “Oh, you seem like such a happy, like glowing person,” but then I’m in bed crying myself to sleep. And it’s hard because I try to be really transparent with my fans and people who follow me as much as I can,” Beer admits.</p><p>“Vanessa and I have similar experiences in the skin-care world.&nbsp;We’re both young people in the industry looking to maintain good skin while being on camera all the time,” she says.</p><p>Although Beer struggled to find her confidence, while having cystic acne, she hopes to help others who are going through the same thing.</p><p>“You’ve got to be your own best friend, and really hold your own hand through the process, and just be patient with it. Love yourself, regardless of if you are breaking out or if you’re not. Your skin does not define you in any way,” she says.</p><p>KNOW Beauty is out NOW and available to purchase at <a href=#>knowbeauty.com</a>.</p><h2 class="g1-beta g1-beta-2nd">What's Your Reaction?</h2><span class=ppma-layout-prefix></span> <span class="ppma-category-group ppma-category-group-"><ul class=pp-multiple-authors-boxes-ul><li class="pp-multiple-authors-boxes-li author_index_0 author_tatiana has-avatar" readability=0><img data-del=avatar alt="Tatiana Mekikyan" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_7975-110x110.jpg height=80 width=80 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="pp-author-boxes-description multiple-authors-description">Tatiana is a graduate student at Loyola Marymount University.
