Purely in commercial terms, this was going to be the biggest event of Chandler's career.</p><p>Then UFC president Dana White <a href=# rel=noopener>confirmed</a> McGregor suffered an undisclosed injury that would preclude him from competing. McGregor finally addressed the situation, which had been lingering for weeks, but didn't provide any specifics about his injury or when he might be back.</p>Conor McGregor <span class=acct>@TheNotoriousMMA</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Very tough to be ruled out of my scheduled return bout. I picked up an injury prior to the press conference that required more time to heal than was available to me. The decision to postpone the fight was not made lightly, but one made in consultation with my doctors, the UFC,… &lt;a href="https://t.co/ACNnbvr27p">pic.twitter.com/ACNnbvr27p&lt;/a></p><p>Through it all, Chandler has remained reflective about how things unfolded.</p><p>In an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram post</a> shortly after the official announcement, the 38-year-old said McGregor "was never the safe bet as an opponent, he was always the highest risk."</p><p>"Maybe the highest reward… but the biggest opportunity," he wrote. "There is no right or wrong in business… you only take risk to grow, or remain comfortable where you are."</p><p>Having once again been thrown into a state of limbo, Chandler isn't wasting any time lamenting what could've been.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmp%2BdnyMpqCcoJGauW6vx5qlnaSVp3qlu82tZLKnpWKxor7EZpuiq6KawLGxwq1kpp1dlsBur86npqtlnZi0s7HGqKlmrZaYeqe1xqGrZpuRo7CmuMSd</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lupita-jones.html><span>←</span><span>Lupita Jones: Mexican Actress, Model, Miss Universe, Movies &amp;amp; TV Shows, Husband, Age, Height, Net Wo</span></a>
