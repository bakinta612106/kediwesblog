Catherine Cat Wong, a 26-year-old dancer from New York City, will be one of the contestants.&nbsp;Cat adores dancing and picnics, and her perfect date consists of cheese and crackers in Central Park. The New Yorker in her enjoys hotdogs and despises dinner dates. In the future, she plans to cruise across the globe while following her dream of becoming a professional dancer. In high school, she was a sailing teacher.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Catherine-Cat-Wong-1.jpg alt="Catherine Cat Wong" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Cat now has 4,479 Instagram followers, which is expected to grow after the episode airs.

She routinely shares pictures of herself having fun with pals and adds shots from her trips to Miami and Las Vegas. Her highlights show that the Cats were involved behind the scenes at both the 2018 NFL Draft in Dallas and the NBA All-Star weekend in Charlotte, North Carolina, the same year.</p><p>According to her ABC bio:</p><p>“Cat likes living in New York City, dancing, and having a picnic in the park. Cat and cheese and crackers in Central Park? To us, this seems like a lovely one-on-one date! Cat is eager to meet someone who accepts her for who she is and would prioritize her. Cat feels that true love is within her grasp, and we hope she is correct.”</p><p>Cat is one of five individuals from The Bachelor season 27 who previously knew Zach. While watching The Bachelorette: After the Final Rose, Cat, Brianna, Bailey, Christina, and Brooklyn met their future cast mates and prospective love partners.
