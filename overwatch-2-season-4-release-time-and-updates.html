That should have been everyone’s first hint that the game’s next season is almost here.</p><p>On April 4, one day after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">PCGamesN</a> published an article on the recently-leaked Lifeweaver, Blizzard officially announced <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Overwatch 2</strong> Season 4</a>. According to the trailer, the new season will land tomorrow, April 11, but the video doesn’t provide a more concrete window. For that, you need the <strong>Overwatch 2</strong> website.</p><p><strong>Overwatch</strong>’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4 blog post</a> states <strong>Overwatch 2: Season 4</strong> will be released at 11 am PDT/2 pm EST on April 11th. However, the update will require a beefy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">38 additional GB</a> of space, which, for context, is more than vanilla <strong>Overwatch 2</strong> required when it launched. Regardless of your internet speeds, you might want to start pre-downloading the update to start playing on the dot. Sadly, that feature is only available for the PC version of the game. Just open your Battle.net client, select <strong>Overwatch 2</strong>, and click on the “Download Pre-release Content” button, which should be on the bottom-left corner of the app.</p><p>Since Lifeweaver is Season 4’s new hero, he is figuratively and literally the face of the update. He is a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Support hero</a> (obviously), and his main weapon can switch between a flower that can heal allies when charged and a thorn-spewing SMG. Lifeweaver can also toss down a flower that springs anyone who steps on it into the air, pull allies away from danger and give them a shielding bubble while doing so, and dash in any direction with a self-heal. As for Lifeweaver’s ultimate ability, he plants a time-limited tree that not only breaks nearby lines of sight but also acts as a HOT (healing over time) totem.</p><p><a href=#>Danofgeek</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8yoraKdXa%2B8r7GOqK2eqqeWwaS0jGtkrJ2RqLyveZNmqZ6klZbApnnToqSeZZGjsW7Bz52YrZ2jZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./my-brother-killed-my-mother-and-now-i-fear-hell-get-out-of-prison-soon.html><span>←</span><span>My brother killed my mother and now I fear hell get out of prison soon</span></a>
