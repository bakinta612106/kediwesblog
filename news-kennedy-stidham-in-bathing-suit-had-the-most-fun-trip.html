One of her favorites is pilates. According to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>research,</span></a><span> Pilates exercises are designed to increase muscle strength, endurance, and flexibility, and to improve posture and balance. Experts maintain that it is a great workout for leaning out.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Kennedy also revealed that she does high-intensity interval training. There is lots of </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>research</span></a><span> backing up the benefits of HIIT workouts, including body fat reduction, improved cardiovascular function, and mental health. It is also time effective.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Kennedy can be found on the ski slopes in the winter. </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Research</span></a><span> has linked downhill skiing to a number of health benefits. In addition to promoting physical fitness, it may decrease risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Studies have also found that the more frequently a person skis, the prevalence of known hypercholesterolemia, systemic hypertension, diabetes, the frequency of mental stress and the occurrence of memory deficits declines.&nbsp;</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>Kennedy takes long hikes with her pals and her pooch. "hike (verb): walking for a long distance, best enjoyed with forever friends who you can catch up with & have a great laugh," she captioned a recent post. "Hiking is one of the best ways to get exercise. No matter what type of trail you find yourself on, hiking is a great whole-body workout‚Äîfrom head to toe and everything in between," says the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>National Parks Service</span></a><span>. Some of the physical benefits include building stronger muscles and bones, improving your sense of balance, improving your heart health, and decreasing the risk of certain respiratory problems. It also offers many mental health benefits, according to a </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Stanford University</span></a><span> study.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Kennedy spends a lot of time "jacuzzi cruisin," taking advantage of the benefits of a hot water soak. Baths have been linked to better sleep and have even been found helpful to minimize anxiety and depression. One recent </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>study </span></a><span>even found that they may even boast cardiovascular benefits.</span></p><p><span>Kennedy spends a lot of time walking. Going for a daily walk can be a game changer in terms of exercise, especially at a brisk speed. One study published in </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>JAMA Internal Medicine</span></a><span> found that walking at a brisk pace for about 30 minutes a day led to a reduced risk of heart disease, cancer, dementia and death, compared with walking a similar number of steps but at a slower pace.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkpJ2eo7KlxYysq6KcmJa6brXNZpmarJieu6h50q6grWWYlrFuwMeeZKano6l6p8HNZquroaBk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-middleton-recycles-dalmatian-coat-for-art-gallery-visit-pics-2015113.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Kate Middleton Recycles Dalmatian Coat for Art Gallery Visit: Pics</span></a>
