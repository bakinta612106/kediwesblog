When he had a few hours of free time, he went to intercept <strong>Eli</strong> on his way home from school and suggest having dinner with him and <strong>Kathleen</strong>. And after <strong>Gina</strong> went to extreme lengths to preserve her undercover identity in Organized Crime Season 1, only to be found out anyway and murdered, I’m nervous for the people in Stabler’s life! Stabler has ties around the city, and already encountered some other cops. Sure, they were Harbor Police who wouldn’t have likely crossed paths with Stabler as colleagues, but that might not always be the case.</p>[ad_2]<br>Post source: <a href=#>Cinema blend</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX5iurrXLpZhmmpWhuaZ50qGmqKyjYq5uv8KepZ5llqS%2FbrjAsGSoqpSav2670aCYp6GqmrFur9GipJ5lp57BqXnCoamiq6Skvamx0WaknqSfo7Zutc1mpbKbXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./former-blm-leader-said-hes-voting-for-donald-trump-in-2024.html><span>←</span><span>I Love the Man: Former BLM Leader Said Hes Voting for Donald Trump in 2024 and Black People</span></a>
