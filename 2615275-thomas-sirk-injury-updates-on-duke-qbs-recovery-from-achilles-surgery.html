He was a redshirt freshman that season and wound up not playing in any games as the team went 10-4 with Anthony Boone under center.&nbsp;</p><p>Sirk played sparingly in garbage time two years ago before taking over as Duke's starting quarterback in 2015.</p><p>He was tremendous in 12 games last season, throwing for 2,624 yards, running for 809, recording 24 total touchdowns (16 passing) and leading the program to its first bowl win since 1960 with a 44-41 victory over Indiana in the Pinstripe Bowl.&nbsp;</p><p>With Sirk on the sidelines for the the foreseeable future, Duke head coach David Cutcliffe will likely rely on&nbsp;Parker Boehme,<span>&nbsp;who started one game in 2015 and is entering his fourth season with the program as a redshirt junior.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Boehme did gain experience last season, but Sirk proved himself to be a valuable dual-threat option in Cutcliffe's offense. Fortunately, the Blue Devils have time to work with all of their backups so they feel 100 percent comfortable running things if Sirk has to miss substantial time during the season, which starts Sept. 3.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW9pZWeEdnnToaammaNiwKq%2Bymagp6Klp8Zuwc%2BdmK2do2K8r3nDrqKeZaGXwG6%2BxJymr52irnqnvs6mZJqbmJ65rbHSZqquqpeav7o%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-untold-story-of-fidel-odingas-death.html><span>←</span><span>THE UNTOLD STORY OF FIDEL ODINGAS DEATH</span></a>
