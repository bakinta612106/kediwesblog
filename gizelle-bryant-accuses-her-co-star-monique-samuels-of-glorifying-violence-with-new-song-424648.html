She tapped back into her musical roots recently when she released her song Drag Queens under her stage name Hazel.</p><p>The <a href=#>Real Housewives of Potomac</a> star acknowledged the fun shade in the song that stems from her most-quoted moment where she told her co-star that she would drag her. It also comes after they got into a physical altercation that will air later this season.</p><p>‚ÄòIt was a lot that happened last season and this is pretty much me just reclaiming my power back and reminding myself of who I am, and although, you know, I‚Äôm not perfect never claimed to be. I just needed a way to reassure myself that, you know, everything will be fine. And then this song was kind of my way of just letting everything go, getting everything that I felt off of my chest.‚Äô</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>For those who can ACTUALLY READ‚Ä¶ check out my lyric video which is an anthem for standing up for yourself.
