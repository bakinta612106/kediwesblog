Can you please tell our readers a little bit about yourself? I’m incredibly awkward and I like to break out into song sometimes."><meta name=author content="Billy Koelling"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

<span>Billy Koelling</span></p><h1>Exclusive Interview: Scarlet Spencer - CelebMix</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Cousins for Life is Nickelodeon’s new live-action comedy show. The show features two cousins, Ivy and Stuart, who end up living under one roof and have to learn to live together with both of their families.</p><p>Scarlet Spencer plays Ivy in the show, who’s a “Confident socially active girl.” CelebMix chatted to Scarlet ahead of the show’s premier.</p><p><strong>Can you please tell our readers a little bit about yourself?</strong></p><p>I’m incredibly awkward and I like to break out into song sometimes.</p><p><strong>When did you first realize that you wanted to be an actress?</strong></p><p>My friend started doing acting and begged my mum to start as well. At first, she kept saying no but I finally convinced her and that’s how it started.</p><p><strong>How would you describe Cousins for Life to someone who hadn’t heard of it?</strong></p><p>Cousins for Life is crazy and insane. It’s about two cousins who are living together and are totally different and the two dads are total opposites, but they find a way to live with each other and they realise family is very important.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CFL-Gallery-04.jpg><p><strong>Are there any similarities between you and Ivy?</strong></p><p>We’re both a little bit hard headed, me maybe a bit more than her. We’re both trying to make the world a better place just in different ways, she’s maybe a bit better at it than me. I want to be more like Ivy helping the world.</p><p><strong>What messages do you hope viewers will take from the show?</strong></p><p>From Ivy you can learn to really stay positive and to always look at the bright side. From the entire show, you can see how important family really is.</p><figure class=wp-block-video>Sneak peak of Cousins for Life</figure><p><strong>Across all the filming for the show can you think of a stand out favourite moment</strong>?</p><p>One of my favourite moments happened in an episode I can’t currently tell you about it’ll be a surprise, but I got to live out one of my life long dreams.</p><p><strong>Were there any funny moments that happened during the filming process?</strong></p><p>Ron G who plays my dad in the show is a comedian and was always telling jokes and there was one I found hilarious. I was laughing so hard I snorted and now it’s his goal to have me snort it every single interview, thank goodness he’s not here right now!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/episode-still-1.jpg><p><strong>In the show, Ivy and Stuart go on a variety of adventures together. If you personally could go on any adventure what would it be?</strong></p><p>It would have to be swimming in slime, that would be a great adventure.</p><p><strong>I’ve seen in other interviews that you like to sing, is music something you’d like to pursue further in the future?</strong></p><p>Absolutely. I love to sing, and I hope I can go further with singing in my career. I really like to sing songs from Broadway, but I hope I can get into different varieties of music. I would love to be on Broadway through, I really want to be in Lion King or Wicked.<br></p><p><strong>Who do you look up for inspiration and why?</strong></p><p>Riele – she’s a good role model and as she’s on the same channel as me. She’s really good to look up to and see the things she’s done so I can follow in her footsteps. In terms of music I look up to Idina Menzel, she was the original Elphaba in Wicked. She has an amazing voice and has had an incredible career, I would love to be able to do the same.</p><p><strong>What advice would you give to anyone who wants to become an actress/actor?</strong></p><p>Keep trying. Out of every 100 auditions you’re maybe only going to get 1 and it’s not because they don’t like you, it’s because they just want something different. You could even have been the best person in the room, but they want someone who looks completely different so don’t let it stop you.</p><p><strong>What projects would you like to work on in the future?</strong></p><p>I would really like to one day host the Kids’ Choice Awards, that would be really cool. I’d also like to work with Dwayne Johnson and everyone from Nickelodeon.<br></p><p><strong>Are there any future projects fans can look forward to?</strong></p><p>Cousins for Life just ended filming and I’m just starting to audition again so there’s nothing I can share just yet&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Is there anything else you would like to share about Cousins for Life?</strong></p><p>I think it would be a good show for the entire family to watch, even the adults. I think there’s something everyone could relate to as in the show we’re all so different.</p><p>Cousins for Life premiers on January 5th at 8:30 ET/PT</p><p>Thank you to Scarlet for her time.
