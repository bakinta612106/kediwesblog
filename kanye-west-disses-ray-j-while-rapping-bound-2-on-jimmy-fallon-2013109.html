The Yeezus rapper, who is set to kick off a nationwide tour this coming fall, threw out a diss right at the start of his performance, calling girlfriend <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>'s ex <a href=#><strong>Ray J</strong></a> "Brandy's little sister."</p><p>"Brandy's little sister lame man he know it now/ When a real brother hold you down you 'sposed to drown," the rapper began his set, which was bolstered by the likes of Charlie Wilson and The Roots.</p><p>West, 36, wore an olive green tank top, a large chain and a pair of black leather pants with a "man-skirt" (as the <a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a> dubbed his outfit) for his performance.</p><p>The rapper's animosity with Ray J has been built up over the years, escalating this past April after the singer released a single "I Hit It First," reportedly a diss on both Kardashian, 32, and West.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"She might move on to rappers and ballplayers/ But we all know I hit it first," Ray J raps on the track. "I had her head going North and her ass going South/ But now baby chose to go West."</p><p>The singer went on to <a href=#>deny that the song was a dig</a> at Kardashian (with whom he famously made a sex tape in 2003), telling New York radio station Hot 97 that the track was more "about a concept" than a person.</p><p>"People going way too deep," he said in an interview on Monday, Apr. 8. "They just gotta keep it on the surface. I'm not trying to create no war, it's all love; we're doing music."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKapqmaerix0q1knaGjqLK0edGasGaiXay1qrjEZqmaqKCeu6h5waisp5xdZ3qwuoyjoKalqWKzorjLqKVmamBmgHJ8mA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jen-shah-was-found-guilty-on-federal-counts-of-conducting-a-telemarketing-fraud.html><span>←</span><span>Jen Shah Was Found Guilty On Federal Counts Of Conducting A Telemarketing Fraud</span></a>
