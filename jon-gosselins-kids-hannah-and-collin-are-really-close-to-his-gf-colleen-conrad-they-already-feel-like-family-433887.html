She came into his life when he was really low and since he met her things have gotten better and better. The relationship’s healthy, there is no drama and that is huge for Jon. He loves her even more so because of the way that she cares for Collin and Hannah, she loves them like her own.’</p><p>According to the insider, Jon is ‘positive he’ll be with Colleen for life’ and the pair has even talked about marriage in the past.</p><p>About that, they stated that tying the knot will definitely happen but that they are in no rush since they feel like a family without getting married already!</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CEfnJUgnYPs/</p><p>The source insisted that Colleen has a great relationship not just with Jon but also with his son and daughter!</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>‘She genuinely loves spending time with Jon‘s kids so they do lots of family outings, she makes sure they have fun. She is very nurturing and patient with them, and they trust her.
