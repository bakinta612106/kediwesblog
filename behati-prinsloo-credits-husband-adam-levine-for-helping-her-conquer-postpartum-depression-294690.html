But my husband was so incredibly supportive and always got me out of it. I think it’s very normal, though, as a young mom and a new mom to feel helpless and to feel overly emotional, you know,” Prinsloo shared with the morning show.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/ByyJ_yCnPPi/</p><p>The mother of two went on to express how she felt lucky not to have had a more severe case, as many women do after giving birth. However, Prinsloo also admits she could feel herself spiraling out of control, as she battled postpartum depression.</p><p>When it comes to sharing her experience, the Victoria Secret runway model makes it crystal clear asking for support is key to overcoming the depression. In her case, Prinsloo had her famous husband right by her side throughout her whole ordeal.</p><p>Thanks to her husband and overcoming her depression, the model revealed she did not suffer the same condition after having her second daughter, Gia. The second time around was a smoother experience, but Prinsloo knows that might not be the case in the future.</p><p><a href=#>She and Levine have talked about expanding their family</a> in the hopes of adding a little boy to their crew.</p><p>“I definitely would want to try for a boy, but if I have all girls, I’ll be happy, ” Prinsloo shared during her interview.</p><p></p><p>Along with giving husband Adam Levine credit for helping her with her postpartum depression, Behati Prinsloo has also gushed about the Maroon 5 hunk as a father.</p><p>“He loves one-on-one time with them, so he takes Dusty to coffee every morning. He’s a very hands-on dad. It’s awesome. I’m lucky,” the loving wife gushed about her man to US Weekly last winter.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Postpartum depression is severe and should be treated that way by not only those suffering from the condition but those they ask to help them through it. Levine and Prinsloo are a perfect example of how to manage the illness.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeSmrWiwMhmp6uhnqi5sLuMnKmenJmpwG601KyZmqaUYq6lrcxmo56umaOybrLOq2ShnZyltq%2BzjKGcq2WTpLuywcSrZKmno6m9or7TrqRmnJWlv6a%2F0qKmp2ViboF3hY9o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amber-heard-dont-define-me-by-my-bisexuality-2015306.html><span>←</span><span>Amber Heard: Don't Define Me By My Bisexuality</span></a>
