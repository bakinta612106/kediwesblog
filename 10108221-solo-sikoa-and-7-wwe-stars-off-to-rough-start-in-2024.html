Beating John Cena in clean fashion at November's Crown Jewel event was the biggest accomplishment of his career to date, but the follow-up has been non-existent.</p><p>In an astounding stat, he hasn't won a single match (televised or non-televised) in the three months since Crown Jewel. Most of those losses have come either in tag team matches where Jimmy Uso was pinned or by disqualification, but nevertheless, it's almost as if his destruction of Cena never happened.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYG1%2Fc32MrKalp12otqy7wGaYp5xdbHq4w8Rmqq2Zoqh6sLLFZquoZaKkwqi0jKyrmqqkYraveZFpaW0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./slip-shoes-html.html><span>←</span><span>Slip-___ (shoes)</span></a>
