Come on, yo.”</p><p>He continued, “I’m sorry. Listen, I ain’t the most in-shape n**** in the world but I still, when you funny and you got swagger and confidence and you decent looking — I think I’m at least handsome — you get p***y. But a woman that’s built like a plate of mashed potatoes is in trouble.”</p><p>In response, Lizzo addressed the comedian and everyone else who fat shames her as she accepted the trophy for Video For&nbsp;Good at&nbsp;the&nbsp;2022 MTV Video Music Awards last night.</p><p>Of course, she didn’t mention Spears by name, but she did manage to clap back perfectly without actually clapping back at all.</p><p>“I want to thank say thank you so much for supporting me and loving on me,” she said before going on to address her haters. “And now, to the b****es that got something to say about me in the press…You know what? I’m not gonna say nothing.”</p><p>She continued, “They be like, Lizzo, why don’t you clap back? Why don’t you clap back? ‘Cause b***h I’m winning, hoe. Big b***h is winning, hoe!”</p><p>“Best revenge is your paper, b***h!” she concluded before leaving the stage.</p><p>Lizzo also took to Twitter this morning to let everyone know that she wasn’t addressing anyone in particular in her speech, despite the recent headlines regarding Spears’ comments.</p><p>“Lemme make one thing VERY clear,” she tweeted. “I wasn’t addressing anybody in my speech last night.. I was addressing EVERYBODY.”</p><p>We love to see it!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOpaCzsp9iwKnB06xknaeno3qprdOeqaxllpbBbr%2FHmqSeqqNitq951aaYrGWjpbKmr8do</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lizzo-grieves-the-loss-of-her-beloved-dog-pooka-a-heartbreaking-christmas-eve.html><span>←</span><span>Lizzo Grieves the Loss of Her Beloved Dog, Pooka: A Heartbreaking Christmas Eve</span></a>
