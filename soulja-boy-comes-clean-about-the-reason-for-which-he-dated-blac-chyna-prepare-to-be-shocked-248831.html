That’s why I made that statement.’</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BuJNXrOhDJI/</p><p>Another follower said ‘When you cancel the free trial before they charge your card,’ while someone else posted ‘he doing anything and everything to try and stay relevant. 😂😂😂🤦🏼‍♀️’</p><p>A person had this to say: ‘This is beyond sad that she doesn’t realize this is all men want with her because of her image.’</p><p>Someone else had a more respectful opinion with which we also agree: ‘To be honest, I don’t like Chyna but this big headed thing out here disrespecting every woman. He needs to grow up’</p><p>It’s not okay to run around and disrespect anyone like this, but he might have only joked about what he said earlier, especially considering what he posted next.</p><p>Soulja also said that no one can come between him and his current GF.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BuJPV21BCj4/</p><p>The most recent reports claimed that the romance between&nbsp;<a href=#>Soulja Boy and Blac Chyna</a>&nbsp;had been only faked to piss off Chyna’s ex, Tyga.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>After that, it seemed that&nbsp;<a href=#>things got serious for real</a>&nbsp;and these two are a real couple. After that,&nbsp;Page Six was the first to report this, and you can see that Soulja captioned the pic of Tiona Fernan with <a href=#>‘I Love You.’</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGejpMKttsBmmaixXZi8rrHSZpqlnZGjeqKuzq6rZqyYmnqzscCspqdllqS%2FbsPHopqhZZiaeqWt056bZpqclrBur8eypZploKeysa3RnmStp12Xsm6%2Fx6iapJ2UYn91hJdsaGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shining-example-html.html><span>←</span><span>Shining example</span></a>
