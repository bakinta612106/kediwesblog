Later in the show, when all eyes are on Long Hao Chen, Captain Li suggests that he may be pulling a trap and begins mocking Long Hao Chen. However, the old man becomes enraged, orders everyone to be quiet, and discloses that Long Hao Chen has complete freedom in selecting the light element and the fairy.</p><p>The old man adds that Long Hao Chen’s veracity is beyond question because he never pulls any tricks. However, he adds that the other guys can challenge Long Hao Chen in subsequent games if they are still skeptical about his fondness for the light element. Captain Li is taken aback and asks the old man whether he is serious. In response to the old man’s question as to whether or not he is the one who wishes to compete with Long Hao Chen, the latter declares that he will meet the former in battle and discloses that the best sword belongs to the strongest man.</p><h2 id=h-what-to-expect><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-637 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 medrectangle-4 medrectangle-4637 adtester-container adtester-container-637" data-ez-name=sportslumo_com-medrectangle-4><span id=div-gpt-ad-sportslumo_com-medrectangle-4-0 ezaw=250 ezah=250 class=ezoic-ad></span></span>What To Expect</h2><p>He introduces himself as the team captain of the Angel Rays and explains that obtaining the light element fairy will considerably improve the Angel Beam’s overall power. While the old man was asking Long Hao Chen if he was ready, Lin Xin said that Captain Li had tricked them and that he wasn’t the one the light element had picked. However, Long Hao Chen stepped forward and said to Captain Li that he wasn’t doing anything and was fine competing with him.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><span id=ez-clearholder-leader-1></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 leader-1 leader-1560 adtester-container adtester-container-560" data-ez-name=sportslumo_com-leader-1><span class=ezoic-ad-disclosure>Advertisements</span><span id=div-gpt-ad-sportslumo_com-leader-1-0 ezaw=336 ezah=280 class=ezoic-ad></span></span></p><p>Read More- Record Of Ragnarok Chapter 81 Release Date and Where To Read</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpJ2%2FsLrEZqafZaOarq15xKmgrKeUmnp3goyrnKWdkaiybrDArZxmmZ6Zeri0xKucZqyfYsSiwMKhZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-zakhar-perez-brother-ron-grant-sisters-parents.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Zakhar Perez Brother Ron And Grant, Sisters And Parents</span></a>
