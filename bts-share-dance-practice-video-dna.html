As of today, the video has broken yet another record by being the fastest K-Pop video to earn 50 million views. The video passed the 50 million mark in about 5 days and 18 hours, while the previous video to hold the title, BLACKPINK’s “As If It’s Your Last,” took over 14 days to do so.</p><p>The group has been praised for “DNA’s” choreography, which reflects its title at the climax of the song, as the members form a literal DNA when they connect to each other by holding hands.</p><p>BTS’ dance practice videos are highly-liked by fans, and are among the most-watched videos on their “<a href=#>BANGTANTV</a>” YouTube channel. The group has also been sharing choreography videos ever since their debut song “No More Dream.” It is just one way the group gives a behind-the-scenes look of their everyday lives to their fans. On Twitter, they are constantly sharing pictures and videos of themselves. Fans can also watch their videos, including their Bon Voyage episodes, on the <a href=#>V Live app</a>, a site that allows fans to watch live broadcasts of their favorite celebrities.</p><p>With all that BTS does for their fans, it is no wonder the guys won the <a href=#>Top Social Artist Award at the Billboard Music Awads</a> earlier this year. Among the attendees were the EDM duo The Chainsmokers, whom BTS has since collaborated with for their song “Best of Me,” which is featured on their new album.</p><p>Love Yourself: Her&nbsp;is now available on&nbsp;<a href=#>Spotify</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>iTunes</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=#>Amazon</a>.&nbsp;Check out our review of the album by clicking&nbsp;<a href=#>here</a>!</p><h3>What did you think of the dance practice video?
