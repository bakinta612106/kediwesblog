It's a sacred bond," the singer explained at <strong>Elton</strong> <strong>John</strong>'s Concert to Benefit the American Foundation for Equal Rights in Beverly Hills Wednesday.</p><p>"The wedding would be nice for our family, our friends, our community — our moms especially — and so it puts us in the fight," he continued. "We can't get married until [gay] marriage is legal and equal…I think giving people the right to marry will be a huge movement in civil rights."</p><p>Politics aside, how did Mraz know that Prettyman, 28, was The One?</p><p>"You just know. I knew it when we first met years ago," he gushed. "We grew up to be each other's dream person. She is definitely my dream girl."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Since his end-of-the-year proposal, Mraz claims he's become a changed man — all thanks to Prettyman, of course.</p><p>"I see the world through a different filter and I get more freedom," he told <strong>Us</strong>. "I'm not so concerned with the rest of the world anymore."</p><p>"A lot of single guys wonder where their next hookup is going to be, or where their next date is going to come from, and I know that now. I love that and I see that and I feel that," he added. "The freedom now is that my work ethic changes, how I show up on a day to day basis changes, how I take care of myself has transformed. It's been really special."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmaicqWS7psPSaKGaq5%2Bjeq6%2BwLNksKeeqXq4scNmnaKZnpiypnnUp6uipF2crrp5zJqpq6GRnLJutdJmo56fkaF6c3yQamlqaQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jason-mewes.html><span>←</span><span>Jason Mewes- Net Worth, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Ethnicity, Career</span></a>
