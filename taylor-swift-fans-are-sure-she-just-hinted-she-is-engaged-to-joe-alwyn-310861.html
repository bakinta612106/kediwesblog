Swift recently revealed the lyrics during her interview with Vogue for their September issue cover story, and when Swifties started commenting on social media about a possible engagement, the Shake It Off singer fueled the fire by liking some of the comments.</p><p>Swift is getting ready to release her new album Lover, and one of the songs on the album features the lyrics, “My heart’s been borrowed, and yours has been blue. All’s well that ends well to end up with you.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B06EVGCDjIq/</p><p>Referencing something borrowed and something blue is all it took for fans to lose their minds and start sharing their theories about what the lyrics mean.</p><p>“my heart’s been borrowed and yours has been blue” is a reference to an engagement…. ya tuhanku…. TAYLOR SWIFT IS ENGAGED IM CRYING,” wrote one user.</p><p>Another added, “Wait…… my hearts been borrowed and yours has been blue….. something borrowed and something blue…. Ma’am,” and Swift “liked” the comment.</p><p>This led to a third fan tweeting that Swift had just “casually confirmed” that was she was engaged to Alwyn. However, the couple – who keeps their relationship extremely private – has not yet made an official engagement announcement.</p><p>Insiders have revealed to Us Weekly that Swift told her friends she is ready to marry Alwyn because “he is the one for her,” but these engagement rumors have popped up numerous times since Swift and Alwyn started dating in May 2017 and they have never been right.</p><p>In addition to the latest Swiftie engagement theory, the singer’s name recently appeared in a tweet from Kid Rock, who accused the singer of getting political because she wants to be in movies.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>'Borrowed' and 'Blue': Is Taylor Swift Hinting at an Engagement to Joe Alwyn with New Lover Lyric?<br><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/0bJoMNDcY1</a></p><p>— Albert Albs (@albertalbs) <a href=# rel=nofollow>August 8, 2019</a></p><p>“Taylor Swift wants to be a democrat because she wants to be in movies….period,” he tweeted “And it looks like she will suck the doorknob off Hollyweird to get there. Oldest move in the book. Good luck girl,” wrote Rock, whose real name is Robert James Ritchie.</p><p>The tweet has accumulated more than 130,000 likes, as well as a lot of criticism from other celebrities, including Chrissy Teigen, Sheryl Crow, and Patricia Arquette.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Taylor Swift’s seventh studio album Lover will hit stores and be available for download on August 23rd.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeklsatu9FmqrChlql6p63NrGSaqpViwLa%2BxGaqoZ1dn8K0wIyhoKeslZl6tLTEZqCsZZWjtKKzxJ1kraddn7ymecClrrKmXWh%2BcYSVamY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ruby-jay.html><span>←</span><span>Ruby Jay Celeb Secrets</span></a>
