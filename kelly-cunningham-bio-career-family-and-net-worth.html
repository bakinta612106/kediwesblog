She is the only daughter of Kelly Cunningham and actor Eric Roberts. In addition, she is also the niece of Julia Roberts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Kelly-Cunningham-daughter-Emma-Roberts-819x1024.jpg><p>Emma is an actress and a singer by profession.

Moreover, she is the half-sister of Emma Roberts.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=kelly-cunningham-health-issues>Kelly Cunningham Health Issues</h2><p>While Kelly remained healthy throughout the years, the same cannot be said for her daughter and ex-partner. Due to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his high dosage of drug intake</a>, Eric had a heart attack, leading to a car accident. In addition, he was in a coma for three days and had to leave the hospital in a wheelchair. Fortunately, he recovered well.</p><p>As for Kelly’s daughter, Emma, she had undiagnosed endometriosis. The actress revealed that she had severe menstrual cramps and often missed school.&nbsp;</p><p>Emma also added that she found out about her condition too late. As a result, her doctor advised her to freeze her eggs and take necessary precautions for pregnancy. Fortunately, it all worked out, and Emma became a mother naturally.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=kelly-cunningham-career>Career</h2><p>Many people confuse Kelly Cunningham with a fellow actress with the same name. However, Emma’s mother, Kelly, is not an actress or a producer. Instead, she is a stay-at-home mother.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=controversies-involving-kelly-cunningham>Controversies</h2><p>In July 2013, Kelly’s daughter, Emma, had a heated argument with her then-boyfriend, Evan Peters. The fight occurred at a hotel. Moreover, their neighbor called in the police.</p><p>The police then arrested the actress since the actor was visibly hurt. However, Evan refused to press any charges against Emma, and therefore, after several hours, the police released her.</p><p>As for Kelly’s ex-partner, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric Roberts</a>, he also had his share of controversies. In 1987, the fellow actor got arrested for carrying marijuana and cocaine.</p><p>Moreover, he also tried to assault the policeman on duty. However, after pleading guilty, all the charges against him were dropped.</p><p>In February 1995, Eric physically abused his wife Eliza after shoving her to the wall. This incident made the actor realize his drug problems. He then gave up doing drugs in total.</p><p>In 2020, after Emma told her mother about her pregnancy, she feared that Kelly would not handle it. She stressed that her mother would mistakenly slur out the pregnancy news on her Instagram page.</p><p>Therefore, Emma decided to block Kelly on Instagram. However, after promising to be careful, the actress finally unblocked Kelly, and everything was back to normal.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=kelly-cunningham-net-worth>Kelly Cunningham Net Worth</h2><p>Kelly’s daughter, Emma Roberts, has a net worth of USD 25 million. In addition, her ex-partner, Eric Roberts, has USD 2 million of net worth.</p><p>Meanwhile, Cunningham’s ex-husband Kelly Nickles has a net worth of $1.5 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=kelly-cunningham-social-media>Kelly Cunningham Social Media</h2><p>Kelly Cunningham is only active on her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> account.
