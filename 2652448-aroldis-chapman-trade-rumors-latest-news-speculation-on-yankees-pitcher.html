According to Heyman, the Cubs will give up prospects Gleyber Torres, Billy McKinney, Adam Warren and "likely [one] more" in exchange for Chapman. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Patrick Mooney</a>&nbsp;of CSN Chicago added that the other player involved is Rashad Crawford, noting the deal is being finalized.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bob Nightengale</a> of&nbsp;USA Today added that the Cubs do not have a contract extension with Chapman, noting the Yankees "tried themselves and [were] rebuffed."</p><p>On July 21,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Julie DiCaro</a>&nbsp;of 670 The Score, citing a source, reported the Cubs were "not willing to pay" what the Yankees wanted for Chapman or Andrew Miller. DiCaro added that Kyle Schwarber's name had come up in talks. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joel Sherman</a>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;New York Post reported the "Cubs would not discuss Schwarber, even for Miller. Theo Epstein made clear from beginning to [the Yankees]&nbsp;that Schwarber was not in play."</p><p>After being <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">suspended</a> for the first 30 games of this season for violating <a href=#>MLB</a>'s domestic violence policy, Chapman returned looking like the dominant closer he's been throughout his big league career.</p><p>In 31.1 innings, he's recorded a 2.01 ERA, 20 saves and 44 strikeouts with eight walks and 20 hits allowed.</p><p>All of those big contracts the Yankees handed out years ago appear to be backfiring on them this year. Mark Teixeira has struggled to stay healthy, <a href=#>Alex Rodriguez</a> has been relegated to bench duty lately with a .256 on-base percentage, and Jacoby Ellsbury isn't hitting for power or stealing bases like he once did.</p><p>CC Sabathia has been effective in the starting rotation, but Masahiro Tanaka is the only regular starter with an ERA under 4.04.</p><p>Chapman makes sense as a trade chip because he'll be a free agent this offseason. The Cubs, in search of their first World Series title in more than a century, weren't deterred by the risk of him being a rental.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW9tYmmBeXnAq6alnJmoeqS0wKmkmqZdqb%2BisMRmqa6ln6fAbrjArZysrF2jsri%2FjKynnpuloa61tc6nZKimXa6ur7fEnqpmqJmpsKmx0Q%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./angel-number-234-html.html><span>←</span><span>ANGEL NUMBER 234</span></a>
