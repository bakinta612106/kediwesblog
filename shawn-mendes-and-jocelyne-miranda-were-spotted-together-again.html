As per TMZ, it can be a rebound. While the two have not confirmed their relationship, they looked comfortable and happy in each other’s company during the hike.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Shanw-Mendes-with-Jocelyne-Miranda-jpg.webp><p>Mendez is a patient of Miranda. She is a doctor who has lots of experience. There is a huge age gap between the two. Dr. Jocelyne is 51 years old, and the singer is 24 years.</p><p>The rumored couple has been low-key about their relationship, which starkly contrasts Mendes’ previous high-profile romance with Cabello. The two musicians were together for two years and often shared sweet photos and messages about each other on social media. However, they announced their split in late 2022, and both have since moved on.</p><p>Fans on social media have been quick to weigh in on the comparison between Cabello and Miranda, with some pointing out their similar physical features and others noting the differences in their careers and backgrounds. However, it’s worth remembering that each person is unique, and any comparisons are unfair and unnecessary.</p><p>It’s unclear if Mendes and Miranda will eventually go public with their relationship, but they seem content to keep things private for now. However, Mendes’ fans have already started gossiping about potential romantic involvement, given the two were spotted together on a lunch date last year.</p><p>He has been focusing on his music career, with his latest album receiving critical acclaim and multiple <a href=# title="Jennifer Connelly praises the performance of Tom Cruise and says he deserves a nomination for Academy Awards">award nominations</a>. On the other hand, Miranda is a medical doctor specializing in pediatrics and has been praised for her work during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Whether they confirm their relationship or not, Mendes and Miranda’s hike shows that they enjoy spending time together and are comfortable in each other’s company. It’s always nice to see people finding happiness and support in their personal lives, especially amid uncertainty.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo6%2FRoquim6NjsLC5jqecsKtfqLWiw81mpJ6mlJrAbq3NnWSjp5Oaubq6xGakoqqRo7GiedaeqZ5lo6W8tcDEnWStp5eawamx0WaYoJmZo3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sharlize-true.html><span>←</span><span>Sharlize True Age | Wiki, Net worth, Bio, Height, Boyfriend?</span></a>
