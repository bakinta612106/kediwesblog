Unfortunately, the wheels fell off in the team's demoralizing loss to the Baltimore Ravens on <i>Monday Night Football</i>.</p><p>In what was billed as a potential Super Bowl LVIII preview, Purdy and the 49ers looked completely overmatched as they went on to lose 33-19 in front of their home fans at Levi's Stadium.</p><p>Purdy's performance was particularly disheartening, as he threw a career-high four interceptions with no touchdowns and finished with 255 yards on 18-of-32 passing. He was removed from the game in the fourth quarter <a href=# rel=noopener>due to a stinger</a> and replaced by Sam Darnold, who promptly threw a touchdown soon after taking over under center. Darnold went 8-of-14 for 81 yards, but he threw the team's fifth interception at the goal line on the final possession to seal the loss.</p><p>San Francisco star running back Christian McCaffrey, another leading MVP candidate, ran for 103 yards and a touchdown and added six catches for 28 yards.</p><p>The loss had larger ramifications, as the 49ers fell into a three-way tie with the Philadelphia Eagles and Detroit Lions for the best record in the NFC at 11-4. San Francisco remains in first place based on its win over the Philadelphia Eagles earlier this season, but with just two weeks left in the regular season, home-field advantage in the conference is still up for grabs.</p><p>While the 49ers stumbled, the Ravens (12-3) soared and maintained their position atop the AFC. Star quarterback Lamar Jackson added to his own MVP case by throwing for 252 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions while leading Baltimore with 45 rushing yards.</p><p>But it was Purdy who dominated the conversation among fans on social media, as many declared him to be a fraudulent frontrunner for league MVP:</p>Kevin Oestreicher <span class=acct>@koestreicher34</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Four interceptions for the so-called NFL MVP?🫢🫢🫢🫢</p>B/R Gridiron <span class=acct>@brgridiron</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>RAVENS GET BROCK PURDY FOR THE 4TH TIME TONIGHT 😱&lt;br>&lt;br>(via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NFL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NFL&lt;/a>)&lt;a href="https://t.co/X299BZYXNd">pic.twitter.com/X299BZYXNd&lt;/a></p>br_betting <span class=acct>@br_betting</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Brock Purdy after becoming the favorite to win MVP &lt;a href="https://t.co/nCCkisFbRi">pic.twitter.com/nCCkisFbRi&lt;/a></p>Damien Woody <span class=acct>@damienwoody</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Purdy MVP talk right now &lt;a href="https://t.co/zQV9CAsFyS">pic.twitter.com/zQV9CAsFyS&lt;/a></p>DaWindyCity Productions <span class=acct>@dwcprodz</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>NFL MVP might be playing in this game but it certainly ain't Purdy</p>Aaron Nagler <span class=acct>@AaronNagler</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>That Brock Purdy MVP chatter &lt;a href="https://t.co/BXbx42UoUP">pic.twitter.com/BXbx42UoUP&lt;/a></p>Festive Micah Parsons Fan <span class=acct>@demcowboysfan</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Brock Purdy's MVP run &lt;a href="https://t.co/2URqWtVp4e">pic.twitter.com/2URqWtVp4e&lt;/a></p>Jacob Meshel <span class=acct>@JacobMeshel</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>MVP Brock woke up feeling dangerous:&lt;br>&lt;br>4 INTs 😮‍💨</p>𝕶𝖎𝖗𝖇𝖘 <span class=acct>@BasedKirby</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Brock Purdy MVP advocates are really quiet tonight lol</p>Edgar Salmingo, Jr. ✌🏽 <span class=acct>@PanthersAnalyst</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Brock Purdy isn't even the MVP on his own team</p>Felicia💚🦸🏽‍♀️ <span class=acct>@jussassy2u</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Brock Purdy &amp;amp; the MVP talk… &lt;a href="https://t.co/mEsNQQrKVu">pic.twitter.com/mEsNQQrKVu&lt;/a></p>Jeremy Conlin <span class=acct>@jeremy_conlin</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Everyone who tried to convince people that Brock Purdy was a credible MVP candidate: &lt;a href="https://t.co/X4O0LyvX34">pic.twitter.com/X4O0LyvX34&lt;/a></p>TUCKER <span class=acct>@JERICHO</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>4 ints is a wonderful present, thank you MVP candidate Brock Purdy</p>Domo <span class=acct>@Domo8186</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>That Brock Purdy MVP talk was cute tho lol</p><p>Purdy has experienced a monumental rise from being the last pick in the 2022 draft to being worthy of MVP consideration in just his second NFL season.
