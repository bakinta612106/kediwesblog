Thompson dated Presley for four years in the 1970s after his split from <strong>Priscilla Presley</strong> and the two lived together in the iconic Tennessee home.&nbsp;</p><p>With sons <strong>Brandon</strong> and <strong>Brody Jenner</strong> and Brody's girlfriend <strong>Kaitlynn Carter</strong> by her side, Thompson went on a private tour of her former abode. Jenner's ex-wife took to Instagram to share a shot of herself and her family members in Graceland and reflected on her time with Presley.</p><p>"Such a nostalgic private tour of Graceland today," she captioned of shot of herself with Brandon, Brody, and Carter. "I got to share with @brandontjenner @brodyjenner & @kaitlynn_carter memories of Elvis. I designed the stained glass peacocks leading into the music room, the climbing roses and 'P' stained glass at the front door. I also decorated the downstairs rooms, and the Jungle Room… All according to Elvis's unique taste, of course. Really rarefied memories were made at Graceland."</p><p>She went on to post videos from inside the mansion, touching on the "many memories" she has from that era. Thompson also shared a vintage photo of herself with Presley, who died in 1977 at the age of 42.&nbsp;</p><p>Presley gazes at Thompson in the sweet shot, in which the two are done in up in '70s duds. "Many of you have asked for photos of Elvis & me — this is a favorite of mine because I loved it when he looked at me like this…#loveintheeyes," the former beauty queen wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Carter, who has been dating Brody for about one year, also shared a photo from the Graceland tour. She Instagrammed an image of the outside of the estate, writing, "visited the former home of @ltlindathompson today… AKA Graceland. loved hearing all the memories of her four years with Elvis."&nbsp;</p><p>Thompson, who was also married to music legend&nbsp;<strong>David Foster</strong> for more than a decade and has made cameos on Real Housewives of Beverly Hills with Foster's current wife <strong>Yolanda Foster</strong>, regularly speaks fondly about her exes. She lent her support to Jenner as he came forward with the news of his female gender identity, <a href=#>writing of her former husband on Instagram</a>, "Once a champion of Olympian magnitude…now a champion for those who share the struggle to just be who they are. #compassion #acceptance #tolerance #education #evolution #kindness #inclusion #freedom #peace."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKOippSWerW0zqanrKeeYr%2BmucSmmZ6qo2KyuXnEpa2iq12lv6a%2Fy56wZpmkYrmwwsRmpZ6rpGK0s63CnqOappRivaqv0mZpaWllZ4Z1</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lil-uzi-vert-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Lil Uzi Vert Net Worth How Rich is Uzi Vert in 2023?</span></a>
