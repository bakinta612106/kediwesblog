"I told him, 'Pull up.' Told him, 'F--k with us.' But, obviously, that didn't happen, so f--k him."</p><p>The Miami Heat traded Lowry to the Hornets on Jan. 23 as part of the deal that sent Terry Rozier to South Florida.</p><p>Lowry did not play a game in Charlotte before he agreed to a buyout and was waived by the Hornets on Jan. 11. He inked a one-year contract with the Sixers two days later.</p><p>Lowry, who turned 38 in March, has played 18 NBA seasons for teams including the Toronto Raptors, Houston Rockets, Memphis Grizzlies, Heat and 76ers.</p><p>That list very nearly included the Knicks, who came close to agreeing with the Raptors on a trade that would have sent Lowry to New York in 2013, per <a href=# rel=noopener>Mike Vaccaro</a> of the <i>New York Post.</i></p><p>Instead, Lowry remained in Toronto, where he helped the Raptors win the franchise's first NBA title in 2019.</p><p>Lowry may no longer be the All-Star-caliber player he was with the Raptors, having averaged 8.0 points, 2.8 rebounds and 4.6 assists in 23 appearances with the Sixers following his midseason signing.</p><p>But Lowry recently showed the Knicks what he is capable of when he put up 18 points in Game 1 of Philadelphia's first-round series against New York. That performance could help encourage Knicks leadership to continue their pursuit of the veteran guard this summer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmmAenyMpKWim5uoerPBzKiprGWbrrmmecuorquxXZi8r8DRmpqtZaeWwG67zWalsqtdoba0wIybnJ%2Bnopp6sbOMo6aippWZeniCxKuq</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kanye-west-disses-ray-j-while-rapping-bound-2-on-jimmy-fallon-2013109.html><span>←</span><span>Kanye West Disses Ray J: Rapper Calls Him &amp;quot;Brandy's Little Sister&amp;quot;</span></a>
