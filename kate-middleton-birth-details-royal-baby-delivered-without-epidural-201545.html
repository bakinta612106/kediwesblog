According to the source, Kate had bonded with the two midwives during her first birth (the duo helped deliver <strong>Prince George</strong> nearly two years earlier, also at the Lindo Wing), and made sure that they remained on call for a month before her anticipated delivery date.</p><p>Consultant <strong>Guy Thorpe Beeston</strong> was also on hand to make sure all went well with the birth, along with his team of doctors; <strong>Alan Farthing</strong>, the Queen's surgeon-gynecologist, <strong>Dr Sunit Godambe</strong>, Consultant Neonatologist at Imperial College NHS Trust and Professor <strong>Huw Thomas</strong>, Physician to HM The Queen and Head of the Medical Household. &nbsp;</p><p>The source tells<strong> Us</strong> that the delivery went "remarkably well," and that there were no complications at all.
