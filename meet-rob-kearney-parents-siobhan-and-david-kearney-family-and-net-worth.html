<span>Billy Koelling</span></p><h1>Meet Rob Kearney Parents, Siobhn And David Kearney: Family And Net Worth</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Both US President Joe Biden and Rob Kearney’s dad, <strong>David Joseph Donald Kearney</strong>, are fifth cousins, descended from Finnegan and Kearney families on the Cooley Peninsula in County Louth. Joe Biden’s principal Irish ancestors are the Blewitts of Mayo and the Finnegans and Kearneys of Louth. His great-great-grandfather was Owen Finnegan, who married Jean Boyle in 1839 and was from the Cooley Peninsula in County Louth.</p><p>Former Ireland rugby player Rob Kearney was delighted to meet US Vice President Joe Biden on St. Patrick’s Day.<br>Irish rugby and the White House have a connection since Biden is fifth cousins with David Kearney, the father of the Kearney brothers Rob and Dave. On St. Patrick’s Day, the Irish legend was permitted to visit the White House and even pose for a portrait with the 46th President of the United States.&nbsp;Kearney was even wearing a one-of-a-kind headgear that Biden had custom-made for him. Even Ireland’s team, who will face England in the Grand Slam final, got counsel from the current US President.</p><h2>Rob Kearney’s Parents: A Family History</h2><p><strong>Siobhan and David Kearney, Rob Kearney’s parents</strong>, gave birth to a well-known rugby union player who previously represented Ireland.&nbsp;Rob Kearney was raised by his parents on a dairy farm on the Cooley Peninsula in County Louth.&nbsp;Unfortunately, little information on Rob Kearney’s parents’ age and career is accessible on the internet.&nbsp;The rugby player, like many of his contemporaries, started playing in sports as a kid.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rob-Kearney-1.jpg alt="Rob Kearney" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Rob Kearney’s parents encouraged and motivated him throughout his career while encouraging and inspiring him through the difficult days of becoming a rugby player.&nbsp;The athlete was not the only child of Rob Kearney’s parents, Siobhan and Dave Kearney, who also had two other children, Ross and Richard Kearney. Unfortunately, Ross Kearney’s parents and family had a difficult time when Ross was hit by a vehicle while crossing the street in front of the Kearney family residence when he was just six years old.</p><p>The rugby star revealed that he kept the terrible story hidden for many years, but with the release of his book No Hiding, Kearney added that he wanted to commemorate the people who meant a lot to him.&nbsp;In terms of Rob Kearney’s family, the former rugby player is married to his lovely wife, Jess Redden.&nbsp;Rob and Jess’s social media profiles were trending when they both announced their pregnancy and the delivery of their first child on February 24, 2023.&nbsp;Redden revealed her burgeoning baby tummy to the globe in a series of Instagram posts. Congratulations were quickly conveyed in comments on the post by well-wishers.</p><h2>Details About Rob Kearney’s Net Worth</h2><p><strong>Rob Kearney</strong> has an estimated net worth of $14.8 million, according to Idol Net Worth.&nbsp;The athlete may have amassed such wealth as a result of his career victories in several contests and brand sponsorships.&nbsp;Kearney was named to the British and Irish Lions squad that traveled to South Africa in 2009. The rugby player made his Lions test debut, playing in the 26-21 defeat in Durban.&nbsp;On April 30, 2013, Rob was named to his second British & Irish Lions squad.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rob-Kearney-2.jpg alt="Rob Kearney" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>As a youth, the athlete played Gaelic with Naomh Mhuire and in the Cooley Kickhams underage system before joining the Cooley senior football club at the age of 17 in 2004 and Louth at the minor level. Rob attended Clongowes Wood College in County Kildare for his secondary education. Kearney moved to University College Dublin after getting his Leaving Certificate and started studying arts there. The athlete went with Ireland A at the Churchill Cup in 2006 and has previously represented Ireland at the schoolboy and U-19 levels.&nbsp;Kearney was a member of Ireland’s national rugby union team for almost 10 years, earning 95 caps and traveling with the British & Irish Lions on two occasions in 2009 and 2013.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiknp2kYr%2BwroyknJqqnprGbrzAq5ynrKNiwKq7waGYp2WRo7FusMCvoJ1lm5qus7rEsmSfmZ2eubp5wKebZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./martial-arts-in-the-ancient-world.html><span>←</span><span>Martial Arts in the Ancient World: A Journey Through Time</span></a>
