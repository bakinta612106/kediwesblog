She always wants the best for him in life and is glad he has found love. They will always be friends and have a special place in each other’s hearts. But she also realized he wasn’t going to be her life partner and she’s known that for a while. She moved on from that and has been going in a different direction. She wishes him all the best though,’ the insider told E! Online.</p><p>Another gossip site reported that the worst thing about the That 70’s Show alum is that she is no longer going to have the platonic part of their friendship once he gets married.</p><p>‘Demi loved Wilmer even more as a friend than she did a lover.
