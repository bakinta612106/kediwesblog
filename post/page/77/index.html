Snip, snip! For her birthday, Beyonce gave herself the perfect gift—a beautiful new hairdo!
The "Partition" singer, turning 34 on Sept. 4, posted a picture on her site, Beyonce.com, debuting—wait for it—soft, side-swept bangs.&nbsp;
Yonce’s new hair was styled up, away from her face, which highlighted her fringe. The Dream Girls star also wore a baby-pink sweater in the photo, and rocked an on-point cat-eye, too.
The new bangs are only a slight change from the look she was rocking before (long, light layered tresses), but the overall effect of the bangs is completely different.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Chicago Blackhawks beloved announcer Pat Foley calls last hockey game</h2><time>Aug 23, 2024</time>
