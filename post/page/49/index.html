ARI has just released her Halloween-themed EP “Kiss Me, Kill Me”, which has launched just in time for the spooky holiday tomorrow (31 October)!
The 3-song release includes the singer-songwriter’s previous horror movie-inspired single “Murderer”, which we at CelebMix gave our support to, as well as the electro-fused title track “Kiss Me, Kill Me” and a cover of the Screamin’ Jay Hawkins classic “I Put a Spell On You”.
Each track on the EP also tells a story: with “Murderer”, ARI discusses a toxic relationship from her past, which results in her being murdered by the ex-lover.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Becki Newton News - Us Weekly</h2><time>Aug 29, 2024</time>
