I have been drawing and painting now for a few years and completely consider myself to be self-taught. I began drawing from an early age, but never really considered painting until only a few years ago. I work mainly in Watercolour and Acrylics, (when painting), but I also love the purity of colour which pastels offer. When drawing I differ from graphite or charcoal, depending on my mood.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>SMP Cilacap Student Viral Death: Disturbing Video Goes Viral, Full Investigation Underway</h2><time>Sep 1, 2024</time>
