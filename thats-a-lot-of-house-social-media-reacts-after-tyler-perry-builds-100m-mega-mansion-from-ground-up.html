A third fan commented, “Crazy… That’s a lot of house! How much are your taxes?? Yikes!”</p><p>Before this massive home improvement, Perry bought a piece of land in 2007 for $9 million , where he built a 30,000-square-foot house. He ultimately sold it in 2016 for $17.5 million. That person–reportedly not a celebrity–received $15 million when he sold it to veteran comedian and longtime television show host Steve Harvey.</p><p>Perry was officially <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recognized as a billionaire</a> by Forbes in 2020, with a net worth of $1 billion at the time. His fortune was divided between $300 million in cash and investments,&nbsp; $320 million from his catalog of movies, shows, plays, etc., $280 million for his 330-acre Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta, $60 million for his BET+ equity stake, and $40 million in homes and toys.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9ze49vZmlpX6m1osDSZphmpJ%2BperCyjKGmrquVYsCwr8iao2allZm2onnRnpicrKNirqfAxKtkrbGcmr9uvMSrqbJlkqq2rbDSZmhpaJ1iuqazwGakmqajnryvecWrpqZll6e8trrDZqypZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tanner-eades-shares-tricks-to-becoming-successful-in-the-music-industry.html><span>←</span><span>Tanner Eades shares tricks to becoming successful in the music industry</span></a>
