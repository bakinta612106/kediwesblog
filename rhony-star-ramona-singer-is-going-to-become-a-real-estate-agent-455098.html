The outlet claimed Singer is stepping back from her Pinot Grigio brand and skincare to luxurious real estate.</p><p>A source who spoke with Gimmie in recent news claimed the blonde is now studying for her real estate license in New York City, and while she hasn’t gotten her hands on it yet, she has joined Michael Lorber’s team at Douglas Elliman.</p><p>Reportedly, Singer became acquainted with Elliman after she hired his firm to represent her when she sold a $4 million apartment on the Upper East Side of New York City. The New York Post says the home – which has four bedrooms and three-and-a-half bathrooms – went up for sale back in 2018 and it finally sold at nearly $5 million.</p><p>Singer bought the house back in 1998 for $1.42 million along with her husband, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=post data-id=297654>Mario Singer</a>. This wouldn’t be the first time a Real Housewives alum began looking for another income stream.</p><figure class=wp-block-embed readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CHbkp7Hhuf0/</p></figure><p>As it was previously reported, NeNe Leakes, the Real Housewives of Atlanta main-stay, had backed away from the popular reality television series after years of working with them. This was right around the same time as <a href=# data-type=post data-id=450742 rel="noreferrer noopener">Tamar Braxton’s reported suicide attempt</a> as well.</p><p>NeNe also took to her account at one point to insinuate that her relationship with Bravo wasn’t great and she felt as though she had been taken advantage of.</p><p>Regarding Singer, earlier this year, Ramona was in the headlines again when she had been accused by one of her castmates of partying in the Hamptons despite the COVID-19 pandemic. This came not long after a few of the Real Housewives spin-offs began filming their episodes virtually.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Despite the network’s attempt at keeping things going, fans on social media have nearly unanimously agreed that the shows weren’t the same. Fans have been eagerly awaiting for things to get back to normal.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeinbyvxYysq5qqXaeurrvNmmSsoZ6csrN5yKxkoKeZo7RuwM5mmZ6bn6Kybq2Mq5yapF2awLWt055kmp%2BVo8FugJRuZ3JwXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rasheeda-frost-gets-ready-for-the-workshop-that-will-take-place-at-the-frost-bistro-this-weekend-301650.html><span>←</span><span>Rasheeda Frost Gets Ready For The Workshop That Will Take Place At The Frost Bistro This Weekend</span></a>
