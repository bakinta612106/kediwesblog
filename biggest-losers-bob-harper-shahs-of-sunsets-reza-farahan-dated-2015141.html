<span>Kelle Repass</span></p><h1>Biggest Loser's Bob Harper, Shahs of Sunset's Reza Farahan Dated</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Call it the Biggest Sunset! The Biggest Loser's <strong><a href=#>Bob Harper</a></strong> confirmed Tuesday, Jan. 13, on Watch What Happens Live, that he and Shahs of Sunset star <strong>Reza Farahan</strong> once dated!</p><p>A fan asked the celebrity trainer, 49, if it "was true" that he and Farahan, 41, were once a romantic item. "Did you?" fellow guest <strong>Lisa Rinna</strong> asked incredulously.</p><p>"We had a thing," Harper grinned in response. "A very very long time ago… It was a tawdry little thing."</p><p>Despite the brevity of their fling, Harper added that there was no bad blood between him and the outrageous Bravo reality star. "I love Reza, I love him," he insisted.</p><p>While Farahan has not yet addressed Harper's amazing confession, the Shahs of Sunset standout <a href=#>retweeted</a> an account called @Leo_Tweets on Tuesday, about the habits of people whose birthdays fall under the Leo zodiac sign (which is coincidentally his own and Harper's, too). "#Leo's make the best lovers," one post read.</p><p>Several years ago, Farahan hinted a potential fling after he posted an old photo with the athletic trainer on his WhoSay account. "Me and Bob Harper from NBC's 'Biggest Loser' circa 199……" he captioned the pic.</p><p>However, Farahan is taken! The Bravo-lebrity is set to marry his partner <strong>Adam Neely</strong>, whom he met back in 2010, and proposed to in August 2013. "I finally met the love of my life," Farahan gushed to <a href=#>Bravo's blog</a> last winter. "I've lived my life with one foot in and the other out. [Getting engaged] was the catalyst for me to shut the door on my whoreish ways for good!"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Harper, for his part, <a href=#>came out as gay</a> on The Biggest Loser in November 2013, in hopes to encourage a show contestant who was struggling with coming out. "I'm gay," Harper told the contestant <strong>Bobby Saleem</strong> in a heart-to-heart. "I knew a very long time ago that I was gay. When I came out — when I was 17 years old — it was one of those things where I realized that there was going to be so many obstacles, but being gay doesn't mean being weak. And being gay doesn't mean that you are less than anybody else. It's just who you are."</p><p>The health expert, who is currently single, also revealed on WWHL on Tuesday that he once hooked up <a href=#>with a professional athlete</a>. Without disclosing names, the star confirmed that the person played baseball, but was not in the MLB at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>Watch a clip from his WWHL appearance above!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJmin5eawLV5y6iqnqqjYq%2BwroyhmKuolad6tLTAoapmp5ZiwLa60p6rrGWimseiecWaqZqgkaN6pa3TnptmamBmgnKAkA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./beavers-display-nyt-crossword-clue-find-puzzle-answer-here-1174945.html><span>←</span><span>Beaver's display?
