The best part? The actress documented the funny meet-and-greet on Instagram!</p><p><a href=#>MORE: Drew Barrymore Gets a New Tattoo of Her Daughters’ Names — See the Pic!</a></p><p>“Definitely one of the more surreal moments of my life. This sweetie pie young officer drove by outside my friend’s house and stopped to tell me he had my face tattooed on his arm — of course I HAD to see it! So cool and such a trip,” Jessica captioned a video shared on the social media outlet.</p><p>“Wow, so cool!” one of Jess’s 9.7 million followers commented on the clip with another adding, “That’s crazy but @JessicaAlba is worth it!”</p><p>The Good Luck Chuck star has a few tattoos of her own. Earlier this year, the mom-of-two — she shares <a href=#>daughters <strong>Honor</strong>, 8, and <strong>Haven</strong>, 5, with husband <strong>Cash Warren</strong></a> — revealed the interesting meaning behind her wrist tattoo.</p><p><a href=#>MORE: Jessica Alba and Kate Hudson Take Their Kids to a Taylor Swift Concert — See the Pics!</a></p><p>“That was called ‘My First Breakup,'” Jessica joked during a September 2016 appearance on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. “It’s lotus in Sanskrit. It means the manifestation of spiritual beauty.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/jessica-alba-instagram.png><p>Jess posing with her superfan’s tattoo of her face.</p><p>“[My ex-boyfriend] was really anti-tattoos, and I felt like after I broke up with him, I found myself again,” she added. “It’s unnecessary to talk about this. He’s like a famous actor.”</p><p><a href=#>MUST SEE: Johnny McDaid Gets a New Tattoo of Love Courteney Cox’s Initials</a></p><p>Jessica also has a tattoo of a bow on her lower back. She previously had flower and ladybug ink on the back of her neck, but has gotten those tattoos removed.</p><p>The actress isn’t the only star who has encountered a superfan with their face tattooed on them. Last year, <strong>Eva Longoria</strong> met a Finnish man with her portrait inked on his lower leg. “This is insane! He has a tattoo of my face on his leg! Oh my god!” Eva captioned a <a href=#>video of herself checking out the tattoo</a> on her Instagram page. Too funny!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2OwrbvSnqmwnZWgubp6wqikaKifqMG0e8meqqyhk5Z6orjBmmSkmaSaeqnBw6ymp2WbnrG0edOasKWnomLAuLXFrWScp56YsrPAjKmfqKyfqHp3hI9sZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leonidas-so-cool.html><span>←</span><span>Leonidas So Cool - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Career, Wiki</span></a>
