Simpson’s</strong> famous 1995 murder trial, and yet new information continues to pour in about his past. <strong>Lawrence Schiller</strong>, who wrote American Tragedy: The Uncensored Story of the O.J. Simpson Defense, now claims in a new interview that the former NFL player once tried to kill himself in the childhood bedroom of none other than <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>.</p><p>Schiller followed Simpson’s case as he stood trial for the 1994 murder of his ex-wife, <strong>Nicole Brown Simpson</strong>, and her friend <strong>Ron Goldman</strong>. In a new interview with <a href=#>ABC News’ 20/20,</a> Schiller reveals that Simpson’s lawyer — the late Robert Kardashian — found the athlete standing in his now world-famous daughter’s room with a gun in his hand. The incident occurred before Simpson’s white Bronco chase.</p><p>According to Schiller, Simpson made “almost like a suicide tape” in Kim’s room that was “intended to be his final words.”</p><p>“Oh boy, I don’t know how I ended up here,” Simpson allegedly said on the tape, obtained by Schiller. “Please remember me as ‘The Juice.’ Please remember me as a good guy. Don’t remember me as one of the negatives that might end up here. Please, please, please, please leave my kids at peace. I love everybody.” (Simpson was nicknamed “The Juice” during his sports career.)</p><p>Simpson was also allegedly holding photos of his kids and wife during his breakdown. (O.J. and Nicole shared daughter Sydney and son Justin. He and his ex-wife Marguerite Whitley had three children.) After making the recording, <a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner’s</strong></a> ex-husband found him in the room.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“Then O.J. said, ‘I’m going to kill myself in this room,’ and I said, ‘You can’t.’ I said, ‘This is my daughter’s bedroom,'” Kardashian told Schiller at the time. “‘My little girl Kim sleeps here. I can’t have my little girl in this bedroom, and every time I come in here, I’m going to see your body lying in this. You can’t do that.'”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Simpson was <a href=#>eventually found not guilty</a> for the murders of Simpson and Goldman. Eight years later, Kardashian died at age 59 from esophageal cancer in September 2003. (He and Jenner ended their 13-year marriage in 1991 and shared daughters <strong>Kourtney</strong> and <strong>Khloe</strong>, and son <strong>Rob</strong>.)</p><p>Jenner — who was best friends with Nicole — recently <a href=#>said in the documentary,</a> The Secret Tapes of the O.J. Case: The Untold Story, that she feels guilty about not speaking up when she saw signs of abuse in Nicole and O.J.’s marriage.</p><p>“At the end of Nicole’s life, I think she finally was at a place where she knew she had to be more vocal with what was going on and she was in trouble,” Jenner says in the film. “The one thing she would tell all of us by the time, you know, it got to that level was, ‘He’s going to kill me and he’s going to get away with it.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKajZaOeurG%2FzqdkmqSdpMC1ecqio6WdlGK1qrnSnqOfZZmjeqy1zGaimqqUlsCptcCnqmaqn6S6brDErZiipKNif3F9lGxncg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./monster-musume-season-2-release-date-cast-plot-predictions-trailer.html><span>←</span><span>Monster Musume Season 2: Release Date, Cast, Plot, Storyline And Other Updates That You Dont Want</span></a>
