Unbeknownst to her TV fans, she was already making a name for herself as a promising young artist in the mid-1990s.

I just thought, I want to change the conversation a little bit. I didn’t want to talk about the next project. I felt like I was reading the same script. I got tired of it.'She further elaborated: ' I didn’t do a lot of research, I just pulled the trigger. I can think myself out of something easily; if I think too much I won’t do it. It’s better for me to feel something and just go for it. A lot of people read books about parenting. I didn’t do any of that. I was like, When the child is here, I’m just going to figure it out.'<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/2f34867ece7e8a82.jpg><h3>Lucy Liu's movies and TV shows</h3><p class=align-left>The actress's most recognisable role is Alex Munday in the 2000's <i>Charlie's Angels</i> franchise reboot, considered her breakout role.
