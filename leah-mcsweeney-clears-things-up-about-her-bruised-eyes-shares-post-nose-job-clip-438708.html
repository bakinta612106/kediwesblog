That’s right! <a href=# title="Leah McSweeney Says That Ramona Singer Tried To Get Her Kicked Off RHONY">Leah McSweeney</a> has undergone plastic surgery and she proved that she has nothing to hide when it comes to her followers since she posted a post-op clip that showed her all bruised up and swollen after nose job.</p><p>This was also meant to clear up the rumors regarding her ‘black eyes’ as she says that fans have been sending her DMs regarding the bruises.</p><p>That being said, she made it very clear that she has absolutely nothing she wishes to hide and explained: ‘I got a rhinoplasty and a septoplasty. I couldn’t be happier. I have been wanting one for so long and now I can also breathe, which is great.’</p><p><img decoding=async alt width=327 height=522 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/screen_shot.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>What this means is that the reality TV star went under the knife not just for aesthetics but also for medical purposes since a septoplasty is meant to straighten a deviated septum, making it much easier to breathe.</p><p>The rhinoplasty, on the other hand, is strictly cosmetic and refers to changing the shape of someone’s nose.</p><p>She went on to stress that ‘I’m just never going to be one of those b****es that pretends like it’s not work, it’s contour because that’s f***ing weird.’</p><p>In the meantime, she gave an interview via ET and discussed her very first season on the Bravo show and it sounds like she’s had a really positive experience so far.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>‘It’s been so nice and it’s so great. I cannot imagine if, what if everybody hated me and they were harassing me on social media? I wouldn’t be able to deal with that and the pandemic at the same time right now. I just would not be able to. God gives you what you can handle and I wouldn’t be able to handle that anyway. It is so nice, it is nice to have support,’ she dished via video chat.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGecmq6pecycqrCdlaOyunnCpZyaqqNiwam1zaCqZq2gYq6ju9StZKGdomKvs8HIrJydZZWusrR50qGYq52jYr2wv9NmpairlWK3sK6MnKOiqF1pgHmDj3Fm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cagliari-vs-lazio-2024-2-11-17-30.html><span>←</span><span>Lazio Beat Cagliari</span></a>
