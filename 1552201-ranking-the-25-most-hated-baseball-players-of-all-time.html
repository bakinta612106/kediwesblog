To find one of those people, I’d imagine is nearly impossible. It’s not that A-Rod tries to be the bad guy; that’s just who he is and who he’ll always be.</p><p>Rodriguez, who used to be one of the top players in baseball, has been continually linked to steroids and he has even admitted the use of performance-enhancing drugs. When it finally seemed like A-Rod was off the juice, injuries started to take a toll on him and his lucrative contract began to look embarrassingly stupid.</p><p>Over the last two seasons, A-Rod has played in 221 games, hitting 34 home runs with an OPS of .801. Over the course of his career, A-Rod has hit at least 34 home runs in a season 12 times. Yes, 12 times! But the fact that he’ll likely miss majority of the 2013 season, if not all of it, because of a second hip operation speaks to how overpaid and overvalued he truly is. He’s set to make $28 million this year.</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2012 Men’s Journal</a> poll of 100 players, Rodriguez was voted the second-most hated player in baseball. So it’s not only fans who dislike the third baseman, but those who play alongside of and against him as well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaG5tYmd9cnnRmqWkoZ6cerW0xGZpbmWdpMC1eceaq56cXZeutLHBmqOlZaChrrqx0axkqJ5dlrmtedOipJ4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./raanan-katz-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Raanan Katz Net Worth Phone Number, House Address, Wiki</span></a>
